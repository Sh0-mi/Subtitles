1
00:00:00,452 --> 00:00:04,243
TL/n: First time subtitling anything.

2
00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:08,006
Let me know of any 
inconsistencies in translations

3
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:11,882


4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,050
I was dreaming...

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
of when I met you

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,830
in the 2nd year of high school

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:25,891
That...

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,570
Fantasy-like day of a dream

9
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,568
Thank you for waiting

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,020
I'll let you know when the bride is ready

11
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:38,446
Excuse me...

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,021
Are the bride's sisters here?

13
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,508
Yes

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,370
They've been here for quite a while

15
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,716
I see...

16
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,820
Excuse me sir, the bride is calling for you

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,224
What's up?

18
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,844
I'll be ready in a moment, wait there

19
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,050
Oh yeah, apparently they're here

20
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,110
Jeez, whatever are they planning this time

21
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,454
They haven't changed since high school

22
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,891
Troublemakers, all of them

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,451
I was dreaming again, huh?

24
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:15,701
I wonder how many times I've seen it

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,349
For it to be that burnt into my memory

26
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,771
What a crazy nightmare

27
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:29,349
Thanks for waiting!

28
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:34,828
Am I still sleeping?

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,540
I love you (x5)

30
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:22,593
Yotsuba!

31
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:23,797
Leave it to me!

32
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:33,749
Yeah!~

33
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,788
Today was another big win
thanks to you girls

34
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:41,932
Especially Yotsuba,
you've been improving quite a lot recently

35
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,273
Huh, me?

36
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:44,883
You think so?

37
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:47,216
I doubt that happens
since we're quintuplets

38
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:49,753
No, you can't deceive my eyes

39
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,059
Take her as an example and
practice just as hard

40
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,437
An.. Example.. hmm

41
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,320
Since the game ended, lets hurry

42
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:00,796
The store is gonna close

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,186
Oh, you have some shopping to do?

44
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:04,491
Yeah!

45
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,507
We're gonna buy a present for mom

46
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,437
A gift for recovering

47
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,835
We all saved our allowance for this day

48
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:12,897
Well then

49
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,921
Lets head to the flower shop!

50
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,421
Ichika is in too much of a hurry, ha-ha

51
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,726
Well, lets go

52
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:21,992
I wonder

53
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:24,945
what flowers would mom
be the happiest with

54
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,140
I once heard that the carnation
is the best for moms

55
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,659
Carnation?

56
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:32,907
I don't really understand it myself

57
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:34,839
Yotsuba, how much did we have?

58
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:36,017
Hmm...

59
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,937
Wait... I might've dropped the wallet

60
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,990
Ah!

61
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,339
Anything over there?

62
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:43,997
Nothing here

63
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:47,521
It should be around here if we still
had it before soccer

64
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:49,630
I'm going to look a bit further

65
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,980
Yotsuba...

66
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:57,287
Oh no...

67
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,232
It's all my fault...

68
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,443
What do I do?

69
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,217
I'm sorry everyone

70
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:08,800
It's all my...

71
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:10,809
Don't beat yourself up

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,590
It could've been any of us

73
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,560
Someone's mistake is everyone's fifth

74
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:20,012
Everyone...

75
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,239
This isn't meant to be compensation but...

76
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,457
I found a pretty flower earlier

77
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:29,013
What... do you think...?

78
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:31,375
Yotsuba, is that...?

79
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,140
Sorry...

80
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,047
I shouldn't justify myself

81
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,930
We all found this flower as well

82
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,476
I guess we're just quintuplets

83
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,159
I'm home

84
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:49,845
Anyone there?

85
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,898
Welcome home mom!

86
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,196
We're all happy that you're doing well

87
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:58,572
Here, we got you this

88
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,677
Thank you for everything

89
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,449
How was work today?

90
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,420
Oh, she's frozen

91
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,092
Maybe this wasn't...

92
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,022
To me...

93
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:14,970
The five of you being
healthy is all I desire

94
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,388
Thank you

95
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,060
I think we're done here

96
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:27,138
Let's go home

97
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:35,851
You think...

98
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:37,060
dad left that there?

99
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:41,966
No way

100
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,552
Our last summer in high school
went by so fast

101
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,420
When the second semester begins

102
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,939
We'll be busy preparing
for the school festival

103
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,880
Ichika, you're gonna be absent
from school for a while right?

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,460
I've got a movie shoot

105
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,976
Is your attendance fine?

106
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,360
Somehow

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,494
Fuutarou said he can give 
me private lessons

108
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,470
Even so

109
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,510
I never thought we'd come back here

110
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,615
Evicted half a year after moving

111
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:17,880
We're really unlucky

112
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,612
Whoa

113
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,137
It's still so clean

114
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:23,517
Did Ebata-san keep it like this?

115
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:25,888
Has (s)he been cleaning all along?

116
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,830
It's spacious and nice

117
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,603
Thank you for your time

118
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,164
Thank you for your time

119
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,830
Oh, Itsuki!

120
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:46,290
What were you doing in
the teachers' office?

121
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,020
There was something I didn't
understand in today's class

122
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,158
So I went to ask

123
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,164
I see

124
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,461
I had some questions
about the school festival

125
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,648
They just left the decision to the
class presidents

126
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,860
Hmm

127
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,166
Speaking of class presidents

128
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:00,625
Hmm

129
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,180
I wonder what Uesugi-san
thinks of these festivals

130
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:08,539
Apparently, 3rd years'
supposed to do stalls

131
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,758
Fried chicken and sausages

132
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:12,751
Buttered baked potato is good too

133
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,990
Sorry

134
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,459
Can we continue this later?

135
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,861
It's almost time to help out at cram school

136
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,810
I thought Itsuki would be hooked

137
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,940
Did everyone go home?

138
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,078
Oh, its just Yotsuba

139
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,883
Sorry for bothering you

140
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,141
Is it about the food stalls?

141
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,540
Give me a minute

142
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,600
I can't waste any time now

143
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:49,945
Ah right

144
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,093
Raiha showed me

145
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,745
The ad Ichika did

146
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:29,080
It'll be a summer...

147
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,480
...you wont forget

148
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,040
She's already a celebrity

149
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,774
She made her dream come true

150
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,641
Itsuki said she was
aiming to be a teacher

151
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:43,110
What a crazy goal

152
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,502
Yotsuba

153
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,531
Yes?

154
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,610
Do you have goals for the future?

155
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:52,820
So sudden...

156
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
I've never thought of it

157
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:00,532
Well...

158
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:03,240
You are extremely athletic

159
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,197
There are many options in that direction.

160
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,360
I kept you waiting

161
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:13,133
I'm going around to ask
about last year's stall data

162
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,024
Is it alright?

163
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:18,974
You said you can't waste any time

164
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:20,430
That's exactly why

165
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,499
It's the last school event

166
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,250
I'm not wasting any time

167
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:27,867
That's why if I'm going to do it,
I'm going to thoroughly enjoy it

168
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,102
Time is finite

169
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:31,289
No matter how much you have,
it's never enough

170
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,130
I'm counting on you

171
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:36,992
Alright

172
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,258
Leave it to me!

173
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,370
These are... The food stall menus
that were popular last year

174
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:47,469
If you have any other suggestions

175
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,013
Please let us know

176
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,265
I'll vote for takoyaki

177
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:54,257
It's better to just follow the trend

178
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:55,836
and...

179
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,289
You gathered that information, right?

180
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:02,430
If its takoyaki, I can show off
my skills that I got from work

181
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,109
Sounds like fun

182
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,398
<i>disagreement noises</i>

183
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:09,873
Any other ideas?

184
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,051
I wanna do Taiyaki!

185
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:12,254
Tapioca!

186
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,130
Miku... any thoughts?

187
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,238
Pancakes

188
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:22,621
Umm...

189
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,210
I don't think anyone did that last year

190
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,582
It could work

191
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:28,394
Nice idea

192
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,129
Thank you Miku!

193
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,863
I like the idea too

194
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,403
I think it'll be cute!~

195
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:38,902
That's all for today

196
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,590
We'll discuss this later

197
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:43,311
Nakano-san

198
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:47,092
Are we allowed to perform on this stage?

199
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,504
Absolutely!

200
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,129
The sewing club made some outfits

201
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,105
I wonder if the customers will come

202
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:54,978
Wow, Its amazing!

203
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,629
If you already have a spot
I can put up some posters

204
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:59,668
Please allow me to help

205
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,043
Thank you

206
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:02,770
Yotsuba is quite popular

207
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,010
Why doesn't anyone come to me for help

208
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:06,363
Expectations

209
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,670
I'd like to send some
invitations to family

210
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:09,871
Already prepared!

211
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:11,840
Invitations

212
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,370
Even so, stalls

213
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,434
No matter what we make, I'll be excited

214
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,309
Yes, exciting

215
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:22,020
Are you seriously planning to cook?

216
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,340
People all over the place
are coming to visit

217
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,365
Worst case all the nearby
residents get food poisoning

218
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,580
I'm improving, you know?

219
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,230
Besides, you'll be there

220
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:33,853
So I'm not worried

221
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:37,650
Of course

222
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,270
If you make it with me

223
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,494
There is no such thing as a single failure

224
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,393
Thanks for the wait

225
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,522
Great work

226
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,455
Are you not overworking yourself?

227
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,190
This is the last event

228
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,955
I don't want even a millimeter
of regret this festival

229
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,040
Last... huh...

230
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:05,490
Fuutarou

231
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,947
I had you come all the way
here to help me study, but...

232
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,314
Do you have enough time for exam studies?

233
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:14,345
Preparing for the school festival
seems to be time consuming

234
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,458
Actually, today...

235
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,939
I got my evaluation results
for my desired school

236
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:21,210
Do..don't look

237
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,545
I don't want this to be seen

238
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:26,250
So it's good, right?

239
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:27,935
That's no fun

240
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,693
In case you didn’t know...

241
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:34,350
The only person we weren't doubting
was you, who has always studied

242
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,506
Please take care of everyone

243
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:38,373
This is the crucial point

244
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,034
Don't worry

245
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,310
I'm sure both my studies and
the school festival will go well

246
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,652
Just watch

247
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,130
We'll make it the best school festival

248
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,790
Boys, just give up already!

249
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,590
Why don't you girls give up?

250
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,732
Everyone loves fluffy pancakes

251
00:13:55,872 --> 00:13:57,245
Miku-chan, tell em!

252
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,402
Uh... umm...

253
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,959
You saw last year's data, right?

254
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:04,146
There is no Japanese who dislikes takoyaki

255
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:05,505
Right, Nino-san?

256
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:06,509
Sure...

257
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:08,605
But Nino-san, you said you like pancakes

258
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,675
Why are you on their side?

259
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,527
That's a lie, right?

260
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,644
It can't be helped

261
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,800
I was the one who suggested it first

262
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,433
I'll take responsibility till the end

263
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:22,548
And...

264
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,816
Making something and
eating is a different story

265
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:27,043
That <i>Fluffy</i> soufflé
pancake you speak of

266
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,310
I even fail sometimes

267
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,613
This argument is going nowhere

268
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:33,847
We just have to do both

269
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:38,044
I didn't expect the class to split
up about something so trivial

270
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,566
Exactly

271
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,790
Why did you have to bring up pancakes?

272
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,500
Apparently Fuutarou's mother
often made pastry

273
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,269
And...

274
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,285
If you remember our past

275
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,168
Yeah, I understand

276
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:02,175
That was the definition of fluffy

277
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,790
But... that can't be mastered overnight

278
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,768
You've tried before?

279
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,980
It's the first dish I tried

280
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,933
I still think takoyaki is much easier

281
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:15,644
All the more for a food stall

282
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,964
Even so...

283
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,870
You didn't have say it so straight

284
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,916
I hate not doing things straightforward

285
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:23,528
Hmm

286
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Nino, Miku

287
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,248
Oh the two of you were together

288
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:39,307
Fuutarou

289
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,459
Did something happen?

290
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,118
No, it's fine

291
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,910
I'm quite busy now but...

292
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,537
It's a festival

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,076
Lets enjoy it

294
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,716
What was that for?

295
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:54,060
I have something to tell him

296
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,403
You can go home ahead

297
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:56,451
Miku?

298
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:57,630
Fuutarou

299
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,677
Hm?

300
00:15:58,907 --> 00:15:59,943
What's up?

301
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,263
Before the school festival,
there's something I want to say

302
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,583
Really?

303
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:06,515
I have something to say to you too

304
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:10,170
Can I hear it first?

305
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,615
Yeah... I heard that

306
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,210
Your evaluation test

307
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,041
Was an A

308
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,250
Congratulations!

309
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,330
It's been a long road

310
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,063
But everything will pay 
off if you get into College

311
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,980
I think it was worth teaching you girls

312
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,127
Yeah, yeah

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,139
Hey Fuutarou,

314
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:35,751
Go out with me

315
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,174
Ah! Sorry

316
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,410
I didn't mean it like <i>that</i>

317
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,508
Let's go out to a few places this Sunday

318
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Ah?

319
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,194
Oh?

320
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,880
Are you heading home?

321
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,182
Pretty much

322
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,299
Looking for someone to go home with

323
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:55,553
Oh really

324
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,270
I apologize then

325
00:16:57,604 --> 00:17:00,307
I'm going directly to the cram school

326
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,822
Ah, alright

327
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,953
You're very determined

328
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,670
Umm...

329
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:06,909
How was your evaluation?

330
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:09,210
It wasn't as bad as I thought

331
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:10,930
I think it was a B

332
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,288
Wait, what?!

333
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,323
What do I do, Nino?

334
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,703
I put in my all, but

335
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:25,836
This is my results, The road 
ahead is pitch black

336
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,492
I'm just trying to be like mom, after all

337
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:31,585
Me trying to be a teacher 
is a fantasy in a fantasy

338
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:33,789
Please calm down

339
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,690
Sorry for troubling you

340
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,257
The teacher said I should 
discuss it with my parents

341
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,730
But...

342
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,610
I guess he isn't much help

343
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,796
No...

344
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,179
I don't mean it that way

345
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,190
I don't want to worry our father any more

346
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,699
Worry?

347
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,949
When has he ever?

348
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,502
The only reason we got this 
far was thanks to our father

349
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,703
At least, that's how I see it

350
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:05,919
That flower was definitely from our father

351
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,910
Although he seldom 
does anything directly

352
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:13,471
I think he's always cared about us

353
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,495
I doubt that

354
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,090
At least to start...

355
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:21,254
I'll discuss it with Shimoda-san

356
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,402
And sometime soon

357
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,540
A special class will be held 
by a famous lecturer

358
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:34,189
Nino

359
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:37,470
I'm preparing the invitation 
you mentioned earlier

360
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,103
I changed my mind

361
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:40,862
Is that okay?

362
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:44,040
I must've lost myself for a moment to 
think papa would want an invitation

363
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:47,062
I thought it was a good idea

364
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:48,679
He wouldn't come anyway

365
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:51,429
He rarely even shows up at home

366
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:53,546
Sneaking through some random shadow

367
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:55,365
That a bit harsh

368
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,650
But...

369
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,679
Those are the girls who were glaring at me

370
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:03,139
Let's turn back before
we get into trouble

371
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,655
I understand what you're trying to say

372
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,194
In short

373
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,171
It's strange that Nino 
is in the boys' group

374
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:12,874
She's buttering up

375
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:15,930
Since she must be after some boy

376
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:17,452
Exactly!

377
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:20,628
If that "some boy" was yuusuke...

378
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,663
And Nino was his girlfriend...

379
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,748
I've got no chance

380
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:25,815
Sakura...

381
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,295
Cheer up

382
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:28,482
You've misunderstood

383
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:32,334
Nino's type is not in the takoyaki group

384
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,170
I know that much

385
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:35,278
don't worry

386
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:36,677
I don't believe you

387
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:39,162
How are you supposed to know that?

388
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:41,826
Because the class president 
is in a neutral position

389
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,650
I can't vote for either

390
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:45,571
I don't understand

391
00:19:45,604 --> 00:19:47,074
What does that have 
to do with this?

392
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:48,473
Yeah (x2)

393
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,581
Nino actually likes...

394
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,254
likes ME!

395
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:58,500
So uhh... try to get along, okay?

396
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:01,636
Uesugi-kun

397
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,153
Let's not fall into a delusion

398
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,978
I'd feel bad for Nino if 
that fantasy spread

399
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,120
Nn..NO!

400
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,285
I really mean it

401
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,202
I don't think it's bad to 
sneak in the shadows

402
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:17,969
There must be some reason

403
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,426
Yotsuba...

404
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:46,285
Help me think of what to 
write in the invitation letter

405
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,785
I don't remember allowing you to enter

406
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:54,177
Please find your way to the exit

407
00:20:54,231 --> 00:20:56,862
Hey, don't be so distant with me

408
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,817
I came to give you good information

409
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,574
He's returned

410
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:04,231
It's been over a decade

411
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:10,480
This one is An-chan

412
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:13,260
The one behind is San-chan

413
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,203
Now here's a question...

414
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:19,838
What was this little one's name?

415
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:21,784
Everyone has the same face

416
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,807
You couldn’t tell the difference

417
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:25,870
I really wanna get this right

418
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:26,932
That's correct!

419
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,788
Although its natural they look similar

420
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:31,583
since these five are all sisters

421
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:33,713
It's just like you girls

422
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,971
Now that you mention it, 
that one feels like Nino

423
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,956
Then are you that one?

424
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:41,565
Fuutarou... D:

425
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,674
Fuutarou

426
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,651
I want to study cooking

427
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:04,682
So I can't go to college

428
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,979
I'm sorry Fuutarou

429
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:10,854
I see...

430
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:13,213
I will support you if 
that's what you choose

431
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:19,039
That's quite the conflicted 
look on his face

432
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:20,194
You're right...

433
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,292
Vocational schools...

434
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,064
I guess that works

435
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,172
I don't think it would be 
wrong to go to college

436
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:29,448
But I don't know what's correct

437
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:31,221
But...

438
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:33,987
I can't help but want 
to pursue my dreams

439
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,956
This is all I wanted to tell you

440
00:22:36,503 --> 00:22:39,682
Since you a special person to me.

441
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:40,857
Is that...

442
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:42,213
Of course

443
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,260
I mean it like <i>that</i>

444
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:51,627
Miku saying this now

445
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,084
Makes me feel this wasn't 
just about career paths

446
00:22:56,078 --> 00:22:57,688
I told you what I wanted to

447
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,321
It's your turn next, Fuutarou

448
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:04,703
What I have to tell them is...

449
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:09,681
Welcome home brother

450
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:14,274
Why are you here?

451
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:17,969
Here it is

452
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:21,141
Yotsuba says she doesn't 
remember giving you one.

453
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,637
Oh... thank you

454
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:26,649
The curry is ready!

455
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,436
May I join?

456
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:32,594
Do you have time to be 
doing this right now?

457
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,875
I know about your evaluation

458
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:38,082
That doesn't mean I've 
given up on that school

459
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,830
I'll study even harder, even if 
it makes me miss the festival

460
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:42,048
I hope so

461
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:43,877
I'll have problems if you don't pass

462
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,752
If you fail after all this, 
my efforts would feel wasted

463
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,862
Even so, I don't think it'll be meaningless

464
00:23:51,504 --> 00:23:53,294
Ichika, who aimed to be an actress

465
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,381
And Miku, who's aiming to be a chef

466
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:57,756
Do you think the time you 
spent was meaningless?

467
00:23:57,891 --> 00:23:59,631
I guess you're right

468
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:05,152
Our relationship is already 
beyond tutor and students

469
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:08,350
Uesugi-kun

470
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:11,824
Even if failure awaits

471
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:18,216
None of us will regret 
coming to this school

472
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,042
Or meeting you

473
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:27,244
This relationship...

474
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,448
It wasn't meaningless

475
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,786
Now...

476
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:33,425
It's my turn

477
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:36,231
__ ___ _____ ___ __ ___ ________...

478
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:36,442

On the first day of the festival...

485
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:43,682
To all our guests, please 
gather at the gymnasium

486
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,375
...__ ___.

487
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:44,898
...At ___.

488
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:45,411
...At 3pm.

489
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,123
We will now commence the opening ceremony

490
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:51,192
to the 29th annual Asahi
high school Sunrise Festival

491
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,097
On the first day of the festival 
____ __ ___ _________ at 3pm.

492
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:52,801
On the first day of the festival 
come __ ___ _________ at 3pm.

493
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:53,419
On the first day of the festival 
come to ___ _________ at 3pm.

494
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:54,044
On the first day of the festival 
come to the _________ at 3pm.

495
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:55,157
On the first day of the festival 
come to the classroom at 3pm.

496
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:56,160
Sent.

497
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:02,453
To begin, an opening act from a 
few of our female students

498
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:25,736
Nino is awesome!

499
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,384
I'm surprised she's doing this

500
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:42,700
The 29th Sunrise Festival

501
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:44,095
Has begun!

502
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,306
Whoa you're good!

503
00:26:12,454 --> 00:26:13,817
Who taught you?

504
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:15,868
At my part-time job

505
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:17,079
Oh! Customers!

506
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,479
Thank you

507
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,727
I wonder if I can take a break by 3pm

508
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:28,688
Alright!

509
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:31,042
is that it for the inspections?

510
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,931
Hey, Yotsuba!

511
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,665
OOHH!! It's the red one!

512
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:39,832
The opening dance was so cute!

513
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:40,954
I've become a fan!

514
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,806
Please try our corndogs!

515
00:26:44,306 --> 00:26:45,814
Thanks...

516
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:52,571
I wanted to go see how 
the food stalls were doing

517
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:56,329
I wonder if Ichika 
always goes through this

518
00:26:56,354 --> 00:26:57,408
Nino!

519
00:26:57,813 --> 00:27:00,073
Oh... it's just you, Itsuki

520
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:03,040
That was a splendid dance

521
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,494
It really set the mood for this festival

522
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,677
It doesn't look like 
you're at a festival

523
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:13,013
Rest assured, I will finish it by 3pm

524
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:16,270
I'm beat

525
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,021
I wonder what Fuu-kun is doing

526
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:21,958
It's right this way

527
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:24,146
Thanks for the directions

528
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,521
You are a wonderful young man

529
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:29,958
Uesugi-kun

530
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,735
I want to make this place a rest area

531
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:34,183
How should I go about it?

532
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,701
O.. Okay...

533
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:43,529
Thanks for waiting

534
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:45,739
Hey, Miku!

535
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:47,461
You're late!

536
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,255
Anyway, it looks like everyone is here

537
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,292
No, just one more

538
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:55,888
Ichika!

539
00:27:55,913 --> 00:27:57,262
You came!

540
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:59,294
Why didn't you let us know?

541
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,435
I'm amazed it didn't cause a huge fuss

542
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:03,452
Yeah, somehow

543
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:06,161
Now we really have everyone here

544
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,896
It's nice having everyone together

545
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,255
I feel the same

546
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,083
Since everyone's here 
why don't we eat?

547
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,530
I bought a lot from the food stalls

548
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:16,794
I was holding back the whole day!

549
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:24,836
I love all five of you

550
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,460
No beating around the bush?

551
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:31,396
What does that mean?

552
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:33,918
I would be great if...

553
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:36,512
The 6 of us could stay like this forever

554
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,519
But...

555
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:40,669
I think I have to give an answer

556
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:43,802
Fuutarou...

557
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:45,952
Go ahead

558
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,249
Alright

559
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:49,428
Although

560
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:52,693
I think it'd be inappropriate to say 
this in the middle of the festival

561
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:56,085
I'm not quite done 
organizing my end either

562
00:28:56,592 --> 00:28:58,398
Give me till the last day

563
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,554
Wait, what?

564
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:03,148
I'm kind of disappointed

565
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:06,499
How about a toast to but that aside?

566
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:07,536
Dibs on the orange juice!

567
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:08,624
Where is the matcha soda?

568
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:09,655
There is none

569
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:11,304
To put it simply...

570
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,226
It took quite a while

571
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,666
For you to solve this conundrum

572
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,249
Pleast don't tease me

573
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:19,651
But...

574
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,210
I envy you

575
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,543
Here's your drink

576
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:29,972
Well then

577
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:31,349
To celebrate the conclusion

578
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:33,447
Of a successfuly first day

579
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,117
Cheers!

580
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:38,172
Hello everyone!

581
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:40,344
Today's the Second day 
of the Sunrise Festival

582
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:44,975
Today we are going to be 
interviewing visitors on-the-spot

583
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:46,678
Are you watching, Nakano-san?

584
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:48,357
You still remember me, right?

585
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:49,725
I came here to see you

586
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:52,886
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

587
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:53,572
sorry

588
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:54,782
Excuse me

589
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:57,592
regained his composure

590
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,432
I don't know what you're looking for

591
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,092
is it me

592
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,552
I

593
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:06,832
to see a childhood friend

594
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:10,088
no work today

595
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:12,438
Dashi

596
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:13,358
School festival

597
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:14,538
have fun

598
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:18,128
nothing to enjoy

599
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,048
I don't have money to eat and walk

600
00:30:21,758 --> 00:30:22,358
that kind of

601
00:30:22,508 --> 00:30:23,648
late curly child

602
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:27,078
It hurt

603
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:29,348
You've grown up

604
00:30:29,648 --> 00:30:30,648
When

605
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:34,968
Kubogi

606
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:37,206
Hmm

607
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:38,898
It's right

608
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:40,548
so more left

609
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:41,075
What

610
00:30:41,648 --> 00:30:43,328
you're noisy next to me

611
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:43,808
Hey

612
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:44,798
want

613
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:45,918
Hey

614
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:46,443
hey hey

615
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:47,535
world

616
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,388
you told us that yesterday

617
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:54,158
Dating another thing today

618
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:55,158
is it

619
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,418
Uesugi-san can't even be in the corner

620
00:30:58,958 --> 00:30:59,461
if you say

621
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:00,678
came here

622
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:02,058
Eh

623
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:06,458
Garne

624
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:07,879
What do you think

625
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:08,288
Wind

626
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:09,608
pancake

627
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:10,608
is

628
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:10,988
world

629
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:12,348
Hey

630
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,508
country is my class

631
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:14,508
It's a stall of

632
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:18,068
always my boo

633
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,598
Take care of Taro

634
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,498
God

635
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:22,818
It's like

636
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,048
Nice to meet you

637
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:25,658
My name is bamboo forest

638
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,808
Taro has been my classmate since elementary school.

639
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,008
We are classmates, but a teacher and a student

640
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:36,848
It's no exaggeration to say that the relationship is more than that of classmates.

641
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:38,648
chance encounter

642
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:39,009
is not it

643
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:40,388
I am Fuutarou too

644
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:40,958
to study

645
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:41,528
want to teach

646
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:42,678
is

647
00:31:42,758 --> 00:31:45,218
When asked by a problem person who didn't listen

648
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,458
surprised

649
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:46,958
no

650
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:48,630
these are my students

651
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:49,238
and

652
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:49,658
yes

653
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:50,228
what

654
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:50,828
Then

655
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:52,148
It's clear now

656
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:53,918
me and you

657
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:56,078
which one is more intimate

658
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:58,668
four leaves

659
00:31:58,748 --> 00:31:59,748
Me too

660
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:03,488
Tidying up is also a rag

661
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:03,578
Eh

662
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:05,348
Thank you

663
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:07,448
if it's true

664
00:32:07,688 --> 00:32:11,078
We can indirectly say that we were indebted to you.

665
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,978
The time I spent with Uesugi seems to lose to you

666
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:17,198
However

667
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:17,648
That

668
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,836
I'm not going to lose when it comes to depth

669
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:22,919
Hmm

670
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:24,668
Please stop because it's difficult

671
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:27,408
and bamboo forest

672
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:29,375
don't tease me too much

673
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:31,628
These guys are my few friends

674
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:33,518
everyone is special

675
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:38,376
I'm getting really big

676
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:40,744
sorry both of you

677
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:41,768
pancake

678
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,918
one please

679
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,158
of

680
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:48,488
I have to cut corners on my work

681
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:54,858
my feelings

682
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:56,228
Because it will never change

683
00:32:57,388 --> 00:33:01,988
Hmm

684
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:03,368
Tired

685
00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:04,818
what do you think

686
00:33:05,438 --> 00:33:06,938
Fuutarou was fine

687
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,128
All the quintuplets were good kids too

688
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:11,328
One

689
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:14,568
do your best

690
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:16,038
Wind Taro

691
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:27,698
this choice

692
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:29,478
or

693
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,898
I think I was right to make this choice

694
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,078
mosquito

695
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:34,598
people who think like that

696
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:36,648
three days

697
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,287
was too short

698
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:44,315
Hmm

699
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:51,008
this is

700
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,168
I want to confirm Asahi High School

701
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,498
in the item

702
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:55,718
in tragedy tulle

703
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:56,718
will also end

704
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:02,978
taxi

705
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,010
it's late

706
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:05,918
you know

707
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:11,708
Come to think of it, the Nakano family seems to be going to the same school.

708
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:12,002
drum

709
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:12,373
March

710
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:13,868
it was cute

711
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:14,498
me too

712
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:14,948
licking

713
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:16,594
chau

714
00:34:19,748 --> 00:34:21,038
maybe i kiss

715
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:22,058
I was shocked

716
00:34:23,318 --> 00:34:23,738
ok then

717
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:24,185
world

718
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:25,628
sometimes that happens

719
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:27,158
that's why

720
00:34:27,428 --> 00:34:28,088
right

721
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,578
Even Fuutarou-kun has experienced it.

722
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,061
why you

723
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:34,928
But that was an accident

724
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:36,458
For real

725
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,608
and flew

726
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:38,798
and

727
00:34:39,188 --> 00:34:40,188
with who

728
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:41,718
I don't understand

729
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:44,078
At that time, everyone sent it back with a lid.

730
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:45,198
death

731
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:47,928
who do you think

732
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:53,198
taxi

733
00:34:53,198 --> 00:34:54,198
Came

734
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:55,928
You saved my life

735
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:00,592
you know

736
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:03,307
Because I might not be able to come to the school festival of

737
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,618
don't listen to the answer

738
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:06,618
Kana

739
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:09,848
If you're still confused, I understand

740
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:13,148
no one chooses

741
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:16,527
that's my answer

742
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,748
Don't say sweet things forever

743
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:26,958
world

744
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:29,768
Then

745
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:30,918
this is it

746
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:31,538
is

747
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:33,074
Are you okay

748
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:34,448
Then

749
00:35:34,628 --> 00:35:36,006
I'm not used to doing something

750
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:43,938
good luck today

751
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,158
Hotel

752
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:46,158
let's go back to sleep

753
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:47,293
first section chief

754
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:47,588
or

755
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:48,398
director

756
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:50,073
just left the store

757
00:35:50,768 --> 00:35:51,638
my sister is a towel

758
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:52,638
It seems

759
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,778
I want to feel safe and healthy

760
00:35:58,898 --> 00:35:59,078
of is

761
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:00,468
I'm resting well

762
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:05,670
of

763
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:07,068
Kazetaro-kun

764
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,918
Your family came too.

765
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,878
I called you but I couldn't stay

766
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:14,358
how is everyone

767
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,928
I've just calmed down

768
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:20,198
We're fine, so don't worry

769
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:21,648
soccer

770
00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:22,698
Was good

771
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:26,558
I haven't cleaned up yet, so I'm going back to school

772
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:27,607
B.

773
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:29,258
you send me a day

774
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:31,097
oh

775
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:31,778
tea

776
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,728
I'm going home today

777
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:36,798
Kazetaro

778
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,588
has finished today's work

779
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:40,008
Hmm

780
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:40,388
Then

781
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,598
walk a little

782
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:45,089
Hmm

783
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:46,518
Then

784
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,488
It's surprisingly big here.

785
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:50,978
I remember Futaro

786
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,078
It's the venue for the fireworks display.

787
00:36:55,598 --> 00:36:57,247
When the stalls and people are gone

788
00:36:57,638 --> 00:36:59,078
It sure feels spacious.

789
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,308
It's not that I'm unmanned

790
00:37:04,748 --> 00:37:05,228
I know

791
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:06,218
couple

792
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:08,438
It is said that there are many establishments during these three days.

793
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,658
Among them, the most amazing

794
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:11,530
food on the third day

795
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:12,101
vegetable

796
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:15,938
I thought Fuutarou-kun knew that and said that.

797
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:20,618
Do I look like someone who is swept away by the trend of the world?

798
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,028
once again

799
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:25,118
You look like you're in the second half, but I'm unexpectedly vulgar

800
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:28,148
When my companion sees a luxury car, I look into it

801
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,098
Tension after a long trip

802
00:37:30,098 --> 00:37:32,198
Exploding or Yahoo at the summit

803
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:33,438
I said

804
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:34,598
do you remember well

805
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:35,288
Hey

806
00:37:35,648 --> 00:37:37,688
That's cute though

807
00:37:39,698 --> 00:37:39,968
yes

808
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:42,218
I don't value your honest feelings

809
00:37:43,418 --> 00:37:44,418
that's why

810
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,688
Don't say no one chooses

811
00:37:47,438 --> 00:37:49,510
I don't even know how I feel

812
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:52,238
I'm thinking too hard

813
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:54,788
I'm just trying not to think about it

814
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:55,718
yesterday's kiss

815
00:37:55,718 --> 00:37:56,738
didn't you talk about

816
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,808
human miku

817
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:01,808
It's a problem with Yotsuba

818
00:38:02,528 --> 00:38:02,708
Pooh

819
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:04,687
Who would you be happy to be Taro?

820
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,902
Hmm

821
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:10,878
it's a vending machine

822
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:12,908
I'll give you money, so buy what you like

823
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:16,568
Fuutarou-kun's drink is fine

824
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,968
the bench there

825
00:38:18,968 --> 00:38:19,968
I'll be waiting for you at

826
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,399
What is it

827
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:25,328
2 teas

828
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:25,538
Name

829
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:26,558
Tea is mandarin orange

830
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:27,278
juice

831
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:28,278
is four leaves

832
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:28,778
coffee

833
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:29,778
when will come

834
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:32,488
yes

835
00:38:33,068 --> 00:38:34,088
But I have to

836
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:35,767
what to do now

837
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:37,578
Kazetaro-kun

838
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:43,118
Hmm

839
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:47,778
I made you wait too long

840
00:38:49,688 --> 00:38:51,248
I did it when I achieved it

841
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:54,998
I feel like you've always been like this

842
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:56,978
eldest son has eldest daughter

843
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:58,988
we had a hard time with each other

844
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:05,089
eh

845
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:06,708
did you see

846
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:08,328
lips

847
00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:09,848
why

848
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:11,388
were you awake

849
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:12,888
why were you watching

850
00:39:13,628 --> 00:39:14,628
is

851
00:39:14,798 --> 00:39:15,188
kiss

852
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:15,758
did

853
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,208
5

854
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,078
someone in the people

855
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:17,368
Hey

856
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:19,218
maybe you

857
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:26,148
It's bitter

858
00:39:31,808 --> 00:39:34,358
hmm

859
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:40,068
was me

860
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,848
deer

861
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:45,578
'Cause it's more real than it looks

862
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,228
You can tell the difference by making

863
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:48,098
ancestor

864
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:49,547
yes but

865
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:51,158
just for that mother

866
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,098
maybe you're used to acting

867
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:56,078
yesterday

868
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:57,258
the drama you mentioned

869
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:59,288
The other party is the child of the same actress

870
00:39:59,678 --> 00:39:59,888
eh

871
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:01,538
kissing someone warm

872
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:02,048
what

873
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:03,488
now still ng

874
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,488
kana

875
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:05,378
that's why

876
00:40:05,618 --> 00:40:06,618
you are the first

877
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:10,358
An event that can not be done easily with a classmate girl

878
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:11,708
so i won't remember

879
00:40:13,237 --> 00:40:14,354
forgot to ask

880
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:16,644
Was delighted

881
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:19,244
what is it

882
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:20,504
eyes from the child

883
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,154
Cherish honest feelings

884
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:26,544
what

885
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:28,434
That's right

886
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:29,234
Pooh

887
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:31,454
It doesn't matter who Taro chooses

888
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:33,414
Kana feeling

889
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:35,924
It won't be quiet for a while yet

890
00:40:46,304 --> 00:40:46,669
this is

891
00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:48,824
I want to confirm Asahi High School

892
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:50,124
in the item

893
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:50,774
at

894
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:52,274
exit win

895
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:55,604
Well then

896
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:57,104
First day of school festival

897
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:58,544
congratulations on the successful completion

898
00:40:59,744 --> 00:41:00,744
mother

899
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:07,946
Then

900
00:41:09,254 --> 00:41:10,254
you

901
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,006
How long are you going to stand out like that?

902
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:16,454
I wanted you to see

903
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:19,094
everyone was so cute

904
00:41:20,804 --> 00:41:21,644
that opening

905
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:22,214
ceremony

906
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,405
really i should have done

907
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,534
took over

908
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,984
You act nice to everyone and accept too many jobs

909
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,682
It seems that you are also a helper in the drama club.

910
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,724
stop before the limit is reached

911
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:35,144
world

912
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:37,484
My brother is still a fool

913
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:38,484
I guess

914
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:39,494
that's all

915
00:41:39,614 --> 00:41:40,614
it's not the reason

916
00:41:41,294 --> 00:41:42,884
I accepted this job

917
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:44,804
from the stage

918
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:46,814
I thought I could see the audience

919
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:48,234
What does it mean

920
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:49,321
we

921
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:51,704
I sent an invitation to my father.

922
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:53,564
There was no shadow, no shape

923
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:55,154
No good

924
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:56,154
originally in

925
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:57,404
I don't care

926
00:41:57,794 --> 00:41:58,794
yes

927
00:41:59,084 --> 00:41:59,834
Maybe

928
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,244
maybe come during this time

929
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:03,944
I wonder if I should go look at the stalls

930
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:08,926
hey

931
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:10,134
I haven't heard from you

932
00:42:15,045 --> 00:42:16,964
You made such a bold confession

933
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:19,004
How can you be alone

934
00:42:20,024 --> 00:42:21,024
I'll call you directly

935
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:22,184
stop it

936
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:23,356
hand

937
00:42:23,505 --> 00:42:24,505
nice

938
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:26,534
I don't expect anything from below

939
00:42:27,135 --> 00:42:27,764
you too

940
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:29,708
I mustered up the courage to send an invitation

941
00:42:31,094 --> 00:42:32,204
can you convince me

942
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:35,034
let's believe and wait

943
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:44,526
is it

944
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:45,854
pancake

945
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,244
shop

946
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:47,204
from yesterday

947
00:42:47,324 --> 00:42:49,004
Obviously more people

948
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:52,267
Somehow it seems that I came here and became a rumor

949
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:53,664
no

950
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:55,874
I heard from Uesugi-kun.

951
00:42:56,444 --> 00:42:57,344
Min-chan's class

952
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:58,344
The store of

953
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:00,114
today

954
00:43:02,054 --> 00:43:02,504
Then

955
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:02,984
come

956
00:43:03,104 --> 00:43:04,104
You gave me

957
00:43:04,634 --> 00:43:04,874
I

958
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:06,374
Not disappointed now

959
00:43:10,484 --> 00:43:11,114
for a moment

960
00:43:11,444 --> 00:43:12,764
I thought you were my father

961
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:16,184
ladies and gentlemen

962
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:17,394
thank you for your hard work

963
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:18,344
to this

964
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,174
Asahi High School within the year

965
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:21,384
end the second day

966
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:22,494
To do

967
00:43:23,324 --> 00:43:24,342
Best store

968
00:43:25,143 --> 00:43:26,143
da

969
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:27,949
wait no more

970
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:29,354
To

971
00:43:29,714 --> 00:43:30,714
about this

972
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,444
no more

973
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,614
I'm not going

974
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:36,852
I sent you an invitation, Dad

975
00:43:36,852 --> 00:43:37,852
didn't come

976
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:39,824
Even the slightest thought of us

977
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:40,244
not

978
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:41,364
Noyo

979
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,214
The school festival is tomorrow too

980
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:44,424
I don't like it either

981
00:43:44,864 --> 00:43:45,914
If it doesn't come true anyway

982
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:48,004
I feel like I'll regret even the things I wished for

983
00:43:49,214 --> 00:43:51,614
I don't know much about your family

984
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:55,334
All I know is that it's not a normal parent-child relationship

985
00:43:56,504 --> 00:43:57,884
but on the contrary do you know

986
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:01,094
You're so wary of me

987
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,072
That's my father's melon

988
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:04,118
bread

989
00:44:04,118 --> 00:44:04,319
Dano

990
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:06,494
I can't do it without my love for you guys

991
00:44:07,724 --> 00:44:09,164
That's why I'm complaining

992
00:44:09,584 --> 00:44:10,634
you're lazy

993
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,814
Nah

994
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:13,934
outside

995
00:44:14,114 --> 00:44:15,114
I found someone who

996
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:17,084
After reviewing the video

997
00:44:17,264 --> 00:44:20,023
There's someone who matches the traits you're looking for

998
00:44:20,864 --> 00:44:20,984
today

999
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:22,664
where did you come from

1000
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:23,323
like this

1001
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:24,564
Work environment

1002
00:44:26,654 --> 00:44:27,133
smartphone

1003
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:28,434
I am happy with the model

1004
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:31,494
this is it

1005
00:44:31,604 --> 00:44:32,604
maternity leave

1006
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,154
It looks like you came

1007
00:44:34,814 --> 00:44:35,234
what to do

1008
00:44:35,704 --> 00:44:36,704
it's good

1009
00:44:38,054 --> 00:44:39,054
Kun

1010
00:44:39,164 --> 00:44:39,412
Papa

1011
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:40,420
take me to

1012
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:44,414
what were you worried about

1013
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:47,343
hand

1014
00:44:47,638 --> 00:44:47,954
answer

1015
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:49,104
Without

1016
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,141
Werner

1017
00:44:51,183 --> 00:44:53,564
is it hmm

1018
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:00,084
Thanks

1019
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,294
I came to return the daughter I borrowed

1020
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:07,154
Why are you going home before you die today?

1021
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,494
It will burn soon

1022
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,594
please eat

1023
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:16,904
i know you came to school

1024
00:45:20,294 --> 00:45:20,954
pancake

1025
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:21,954
Is not it

1026
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:23,774
surprisingly cheap to make

1027
00:45:24,164 --> 00:45:26,234
my daughters will love it too

1028
00:45:27,134 --> 00:45:28,724
I wanted to make it last

1029
00:45:29,264 --> 00:45:30,264
what the last

1030
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,024
there is no such thing

1031
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:34,104
quite

1032
00:45:34,424 --> 00:45:36,434
i can't thank you enough

1033
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,034
but no more

1034
00:45:38,294 --> 00:45:39,725
your precious time

1035
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:42,554
Don't pour it on me, who has a short life expectancy

1036
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:45,944
Please don't say that

1037
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:47,024
Lena

1038
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,884
Because my teacher is my mentor

1039
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:50,684
that she is a teacher

1040
00:45:51,494 --> 00:45:52,962
how many years ago she

1041
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,694
and when you're gone

1042
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:57,674
her daughters also grieve

1043
00:45:58,424 --> 00:45:59,424
is that so

1044
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:03,764
I regret only those children

1045
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:07,424
To see the growth of those children who are still small

1046
00:46:07,784 --> 00:46:08,784
my mission

1047
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,384
Thank you very much

1048
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,744
I will pamper you just a little more

1049
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:16,434
When you leave the hospital

1050
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:18,314
please let me have a feast

1051

This article

1055
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:27,331
made by

1056
00:46:28,094 --> 00:46:29,894
It was such a bad day for cooking

1057
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:31,874
I'm trying hard to find what I'm aiming for

1058
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:32,983
Mika

1059
00:46:32,983 --> 00:46:33,983
not only

1060
00:46:34,064 --> 00:46:34,814
we 5

1061
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:38,924
We've all grown up since then

1062
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:40,104
its growth

1063
00:46:40,454 --> 00:46:41,864
I want you to watch me by my side

1064
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:44,244
Mr. Miss

1065
00:46:56,234 --> 00:46:57,234

1066
00:47:00,464 --> 00:47:00,884
Which

1067
00:47:01,274 --> 00:47:02,274
side

1068
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:03,324
Nano

1069
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:07,304
You have faced each other without running away

1070
00:47:09,044 --> 00:47:09,554
what

1071
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:11,714
Even so, it's a lot

1072
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:13,244
by myself

1073
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:14,424
I can eat it all

1074
00:47:15,344 --> 00:47:17,079
Then eat with the whole family

1075
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,104
what suddenly

1076
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:23,724
but everyone

1077
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:25,134
I'm sure you'll be happy

1078
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:26,994
I'm glad

1079
00:47:27,794 --> 00:47:28,754
then i'm the toilet

1080
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:28,814
To

1081
00:47:29,594 --> 00:47:30,974
Uesugi-kun was there

1082
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:33,824
this is your plan

1083
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:35,304
wrong

1084
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:35,714
world

1085
00:47:36,044 --> 00:47:37,724
he brought me this far

1086
00:47:38,804 --> 00:47:39,804
what about that

1087
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,285
Beyond the scope of tutoring

1088
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:46,484
that i couldn't do

1089
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:48,854
I'm glad I asked God

1090
00:47:49,124 --> 00:47:50,124
I think from the bottom of my heart

1091
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:52,694
Impossible as a parent

1092
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:57,464
I hope you take your relationship with your daughters seriously.

1093
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:58,674
wish

1094
00:48:01,544 --> 00:48:02,654
thank you for today

1095
00:48:03,284 --> 00:48:04,454

1096
00:48:06,224 --> 00:48:07,224

1097
00:48:07,424 --> 00:48:08,714
what about tomorrow

1098
00:48:11,174 --> 00:48:11,384
Color

1099
00:48:11,564 --> 00:48:12,564
rice field

1100
00:48:16,364 --> 00:48:17,364

what are you doing

1102
00:48:23,024 --> 00:48:24,494
I slipped a little

1103
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:25,944
I'm going home

1104
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:30,984

1108
00:48:34,874 --> 00:48:35,874
mosquito

After all, at least have a scary dream

1110
00:48:46,544 --> 00:48:47,054
now

1111
00:48:47,397 --> 00:48:48,397
Hey

00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,694
my feelings don't change

1116
00:48:59,744 --> 00:48:59,906
B.

00:48:59,906 --> 00:49:01,663
let me be your tutor

1118
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:02,204

1119
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:03,354
increase

1120
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:14,384
I want to confirm this from former Asahi High School

1121
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:15,684

1122
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:17,834

I can't lose to men's takoyaki

1128
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:30,924

00:49:32,714 --> 00:49:33,164
class

1130
00:49:33,164 --> 00:49:34,934
It's about a boy from

1131
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:37,664
Let's get along without being stubborn

1132
00:49:37,814 --> 00:49:37,994
world

1133
00:49:38,354 --> 00:49:39,434
I'm sure you did it together

1134
00:49:39,554 --> 00:49:40,094
is fun

1135
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:41,274
world

1136
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:44,294
I wish I had the courage to say

1137
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:46,664
Hey

1138
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:47,664
Nah

1139
00:49:47,744 --> 00:49:48,254
Me

1140
00:49:48,374 --> 00:49:49,374
let's look over there

1141
00:49:53,204 --> 00:49:54,204
Uesugi

1142
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:54,613
teeth

1143
00:49:55,004 --> 00:49:55,696

hand

1145
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:57,044
sneaky

1146
00:49:57,044 --> 00:49:57,400

1147
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:57,724
start the

1148
00:49:57,724 --> 00:49:58,304

1149
00:49:58,512 --> 00:49:58,664
rice field

1150
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:00,944
Reconcile quickly

1151
00:50:03,074 --> 00:50:04,634
this time i will do the opposite

1152
00:50:05,924 --> 00:50:08,234
Can I go and check the enemy situation?

1153
00:50:09,044 --> 00:50:10,044
tomorrow

1154
00:50:10,184 --> 00:50:11,714
It's obvious to the boss guy

1155
00:50:11,862 --> 00:50:12,011
is

1156
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:13,705
Oh

1157
00:50:14,294 --> 00:50:15,583
What should I do Futaro

1158
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:17,444
if you could change

1159
00:50:19,264 --> 00:50:20,264
Maeda

1160
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:22,624
Because you're in the opposing camp

1161
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:25,444
I might be able to change their minds

1162
00:50:26,494 --> 00:50:26,824
devil

1163
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:28,053
It's just my intuition

1164
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,994
Believe it or not, it's a good posterity

1165
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:36,214
I believe in Fuutarou

1166
00:50:41,134 --> 00:50:41,614
Nakano

1167
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:41,932

It's hot so be careful

1176
00:50:58,324 --> 00:50:59,324
Thank you

1177
00:50:59,825 --> 00:51:00,874

1179
00:51:11,854 --> 00:51:12,274
class

1180
00:51:12,274 --> 00:51:14,708
I want to feed the girls in

1181
00:51:16,294 --> 00:51:16,594

i will bring everyone

1184
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:21,574
Boys' seriousness

1185
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:23,674
I'm sure it should be conveyed to everyone

1186
00:51:24,094 --> 00:51:24,772
Such a thing

1187
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:25,934
suddenly told

1188
00:51:26,957 --> 00:51:27,544
Those guys

1189
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:29,464
I told you to serve takoyaki

1190
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:31,323
for them

1191
00:51:31,654 --> 00:51:32,848

i have to say

1196
00:51:39,484 --> 00:51:41,734
I'm sorry for saying this on the day

1197
00:51:43,384 --> 00:51:45,930
I don't want it to end like this, it should be the same feeling

1198
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:48,753
Even after finishing everything and graduating

1199
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,794
It was a school festival

1200
00:51:51,094 --> 00:51:52,684
Let's make it something everyone can enjoy

1201
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,214

1202

Maeda-kun fed Matsui-san, right?

1204
00:51:58,864 --> 00:51:59,864
Don't say

1205
00:51:59,974 --> 00:52:01,114
it's you

1206
00:52:01,474 --> 00:52:02,704
You're the only one running away

1207
00:52:03,484 --> 00:52:05,554
Even though I wanted Maruyama-san to eat it

1208
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:06,124
Then

1209
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,330
chestnut

1210
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:08,414
Then

1211
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:11,134
I don't even have a guy who wants to eat me anymore

1212
00:52:12,904 --> 00:52:13,904
Mr. Nakano

1213
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:15,194

1214
00:52:15,364 --> 00:52:16,364
can i ask

1215
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,434
of course

1216
00:52:19,414 --> 00:52:20,414
Thank you

1217
00:52:20,494 --> 00:52:21,964
All thanks to Fuutarou

1218
00:52:23,404 --> 00:52:24,544
i'm not doing anything

1219
00:52:25,444 --> 00:52:26,536
bangs moved

1220
00:52:30,154 --> 00:52:31,154
I got stronger

1221
00:52:41,884 --> 00:52:42,724
sorry 1

1222
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:43,724
group

1223
00:52:43,775 --> 00:52:45,334
Takoyaki and stalls

1224
00:52:46,054 --> 00:52:48,034
Suspend store opening

1225
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:53,807
i found sugi

1226
00:52:54,124 --> 00:52:54,667
People after all

1227
00:52:54,874 --> 00:52:55,874
was

1228
00:52:56,314 --> 00:52:56,854
Do not know

1229
00:52:57,004 --> 00:52:58,054
talking to a girl

1230
00:53:01,414 --> 00:53:02,414
Does anyone know

1231
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:04,984
I don't know Asuka

1232
00:53:06,274 --> 00:53:07,444
I just pulled it out

1233
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:08,734
we 5

1234
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:09,734
A person

1235
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,354
I liked

1236
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:13,394
go to sleep

1237
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:15,494
believe

1238
00:53:16,384 --> 00:53:18,333
But when we first met

1239
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,574
I was told

1240
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:22,504
Believe in what you love

1241
00:53:23,674 --> 00:53:24,754
no matter what

1242
00:53:25,204 --> 00:53:27,004
because i like futarou

1243
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:30,154
Because I like Fuutarou

1244
00:53:30,964 --> 00:53:32,404
I believed and moved on

1245
00:53:35,914 --> 00:53:36,914
meat

1246
00:53:38,764 --> 00:53:39,814
It's been a day

1247
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:40,834
class

1248
00:53:40,834 --> 00:53:41,914
It's a pity that the stall of

1249
00:53:42,244 --> 00:53:43,244
Wind Taro

1250
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:44,534
follow me

1251
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:45,854
rooftop

1252
00:53:46,174 --> 00:53:48,154
No entry during the school festival

1253
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:51,454
I thought I wouldn't bother you here

1254
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:52,653
rice field

1255
00:53:52,924 --> 00:53:53,134
na

1256
00:53:53,824 --> 00:53:57,514
You're laughing at us for not being able to charm us anyway, so who are you?

1257
00:53:57,604 --> 00:53:59,134
it's not the time to say that

1258
00:53:59,284 --> 00:54:01,204
It's bad that the boy caused the accident

1259
00:54:01,744 --> 00:54:02,744
If this

1260
00:54:03,784 --> 00:54:05,254
did you call

1261
00:54:06,214 --> 00:54:08,434
I'm sure you won't get in trouble here.

1262
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,704
No

1263
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,154
I'm the one who's bothering you

1264
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:13,804
other grass

1265
00:54:14,014 --> 00:54:15,574
Miku-chan, how about this letter?

1266
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:16,784
Say

1267
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:18,974
body

1268
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:20,624
During

1269
00:54:23,314 --> 00:54:25,864
Maintain and develop boys and girls forever

1270
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:27,524
is also a high school student

1271
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:29,104
I'm a college student next year

1272
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:32,104
Aren't you ashamed to fight like this child?

1273
00:54:32,824 --> 00:54:33,334
pancake

1274
00:54:33,334 --> 00:54:35,374
Takoyaki can't have ups and downs

1275
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:37,144
Of course men and women

1276
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:38,624
both are delicious

1277
00:54:38,764 --> 00:54:39,994
both of you are doing your best

1278
00:54:40,684 --> 00:54:41,825
can't accept that

1279
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:44,114
pay back debt

1280
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:45,844
It's been no fun since day one

1281
00:54:46,294 --> 00:54:47,294
uncomfortable

1282
00:54:48,304 --> 00:54:49,354
I was patient

1283
00:54:49,804 --> 00:54:50,804
Hey

1284
00:54:54,004 --> 00:54:55,004
make

1285
00:54:56,404 --> 00:54:58,714
The girl is tired from working all the time

1286
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:00,064
pancake

1287
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,064
the back of the shop

1288
00:55:01,294 --> 00:55:03,034
get a boy to help

1289
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:04,534
By the way

1290
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:04,834
and

1291
00:55:05,224 --> 00:55:06,544
even if i'm good

1292
00:55:06,664 --> 00:55:06,874
fruit

1293
00:55:06,994 --> 00:55:07,994
somehow

1294
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:09,584
Leave it to me

1295
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:10,954
I will persuade

1296
00:55:12,334 --> 00:55:13,353
trust me

1297
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:18,284
smartphone

1298
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:19,894
it's impossible to repair

1299
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:22,395
I voluntarily gave up on being a player myself

1300
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:23,734
ON

1301
00:55:23,915 --> 00:55:25,114
I was taught by

1302
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:29,264
meat

1303
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:30,424
girl

1304
00:55:30,754 --> 00:55:31,754
Who

1305
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:34,034
I was shooting

1306
00:55:35,044 --> 00:55:35,344
Hey

1307
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:36,784
Childhood friend

1308
00:55:37,024 --> 00:55:37,234
Like

1309
00:55:37,354 --> 00:55:37,684
Nanoha

1310
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:38,864
as the opposite sex

1311
00:55:40,144 --> 00:55:41,144
are friends

1312
00:55:41,824 --> 00:55:42,394
mosquito

1313
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:43,634
Narayoshi

1314
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,664
You've been holding back from listening to me

1315
00:55:46,504 --> 00:55:47,014
patience

1316
00:55:47,164 --> 00:55:48,164
what

1317
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:50,704
I'm sorry you don't care about me like that

1318
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:54,434
Do you get it

1319
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:55,724
Then

1320
00:55:55,774 --> 00:55:56,104
kiss

1321
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:57,104
big

1322
00:55:57,874 --> 00:55:59,314
I told you to refrain

1323
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:00,634
with the current flow why

1324
00:56:01,144 --> 00:56:01,594
money

1325
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:03,274
I will hear the answer later

1326
00:56:09,064 --> 00:56:11,551
No matter what kind of insurmountable wall appears

1327
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,344
as long as you believe in yourself

1328
00:56:14,764 --> 00:56:16,144
I can go on forever

1329
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:19,484
do not hesitate

1330
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:28,684
this is

1331
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:30,844
I want to confirm Asahi High School

1332
00:56:31,144 --> 00:56:32,144
four years old now

1333
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:33,044
lower beard

1334
00:56:33,044 --> 00:56:33,394
tulle

1335
00:56:33,394 --> 00:56:34,394
will also end

1336
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:41,674
Thank you

1337
00:56:41,854 --> 00:56:42,094
thank you

1338
00:56:42,244 --> 00:56:43,244
increase

1339
00:56:45,064 --> 00:56:46,064
emerald

1340
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,524
even so far

1341
00:56:48,244 --> 00:56:50,644
It's a pity to finish you here

1342
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,804
I'm under your control

1343
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:53,954
rice field

1344
00:56:58,264 --> 00:57:00,214
I wondered what happened to the sheep

1345
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,484
I'm glad I asked a senior to take the place of

1346
00:57:03,634 --> 00:57:04,634
is

1347
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:04,774
mosquito

1348
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:06,694
It was good to be of help

1349
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:09,704
I have come

1350
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,302
tired

1351
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:13,389
There seems to be no problem with the freshness of the ingredients.

1352
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:19,594
The hairstyles around here are dangerous, so please put them away

1353
00:57:20,734 --> 00:57:21,734
at this rate

1354
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:22,144
2

1355
00:57:22,185 --> 00:57:22,294
5

1356
00:57:22,294 --> 00:57:23,294
it seems to be in time

1357
00:57:26,044 --> 00:57:27,185
thank you for helping

1358
00:57:28,024 --> 00:57:28,684
Medium service

1359
00:57:28,684 --> 00:57:29,684

1360
00:57:31,024 --> 00:57:32,024

1361
00:57:43,954 --> 00:57:45,304
you did a good job

1362
00:57:46,744 --> 00:57:47,744
Yotsuba

1363
00:57:48,544 --> 00:57:51,304
Uesugi-san is a bean sprout, so please take a rest

1364
00:57:53,104 --> 00:57:53,614
I'm sorry

1365
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:54,974
it's okay

1366
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:57,074
let me through

1367
00:57:57,184 --> 00:57:58,809
I want to finish by 15:00

1368
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:00,394
worried

1369
00:58:00,514 --> 00:58:00,994
I'm here

1370
00:58:01,534 --> 00:58:03,634
I won't move until you listen to me

1371
00:58:08,014 --> 00:58:09,994
I haven't said anything since that morning

1372
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:12,134
shop

1373
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:13,354
so power

1374
00:58:13,354 --> 00:58:14,354
does not come out

1375
00:58:15,604 --> 00:58:16,604
fried chicken

1376
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:18,064
please eat well

1377
00:58:19,804 --> 00:58:20,804
Is it alright

1378
00:58:21,814 --> 00:58:23,164
i'm hungry

1379
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:24,314
To

1380
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:26,224
stomach

1381
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:27,404
full

1382
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:29,709
I have a patient

1383
00:58:30,184 --> 00:58:31,184
Yotsu

1384
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:32,744
thank you

1385
00:58:33,454 --> 00:58:34,714
i'm glad you were here

1386
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:36,514
What are you saying

1387
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:37,425
Goya

1388
00:58:37,425 --> 00:58:38,712
is a mutual relationship

1389
00:58:40,114 --> 00:58:41,114
to you too

1390
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,354
Just being recognized by Mr. Uesugi

1391
00:58:43,504 --> 00:58:45,124
I feel like it all pays off

1392
00:58:46,744 --> 00:58:48,274
Mr. Uesugi adds the answer

1393
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:48,574
When

1394
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:50,084
two more days

1395
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:52,774
I can spend days like today

1396
00:58:52,954 --> 00:58:53,954
I'm sure

1397
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:55,634
is

1398
00:58:55,954 --> 00:58:57,664
if you choose me

1399
00:59:04,327 --> 00:59:05,327
why

1400
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:06,930
Stop quoting

1401
00:59:08,016 --> 00:59:08,464
We're

1402
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:09,964
If you come for this day

1403
00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:12,154
After causing such an accident

1404
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:13,654
I have no choice but to accept

1405
00:59:14,224 --> 00:59:15,334
warned it's dangerous

1406
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:25,604
because it's straight

1407
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:27,434
something

1408
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:28,710
hey

1409
00:59:28,827 --> 00:59:29,827
Hey you

1410
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:34,699
rice field

1411
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:36,004
Wind Taro

1412
00:59:36,154 --> 00:59:36,815
friend of

1413
00:59:36,934 --> 00:59:37,934
isn't it

1414
00:59:47,495 --> 00:59:48,495
hospital

1415
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,544
I was surprised to hear that you are here

1416
00:59:52,174 --> 00:59:54,184
I can't afford to do it at all

1417
00:59:55,114 --> 00:59:55,444
mosquito

1418
00:59:55,894 --> 00:59:57,454
don't worry about me

1419
00:59:58,503 --> 00:59:59,074
who is it anymore

1420
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:01,354
there's still a lot left to do

1421
01:00:01,534 --> 01:00:01,766
da

1422
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:02,014
hey

1423
01:00:02,704 --> 01:00:03,704
I have to hurry

1424
01:00:03,964 --> 01:00:05,494
Everyone in the drama club is in trouble

1425
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:06,484
world

1426
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:06,844
Chiba

1427
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:07,084
of

1428
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,410
world

1429
01:00:09,183 --> 01:00:09,329
2

1430
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:10,742
the day is already over

1431
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:16,414
6 in Kyoto

1432
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:17,414
year ago

1433
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:19,654
Was it you who met Futaro?

1434
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,244
Hannah and

1435
01:00:23,514 --> 01:00:25,884
I was shown so many photos that I didn't want to.

1436
01:00:26,814 --> 01:00:27,924
pancakes earlier

1437
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,603
When I asked my brother at the restaurant

1438
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,634
I knew that I was the only one who got strayed that day

1439
01:00:33,294 --> 01:00:35,251
As expected of Uesugi-san's teacher

1440
01:00:36,564 --> 01:00:38,124
nice to meet you

1441
01:00:38,904 --> 01:00:39,354
this thing

1442
01:00:39,504 --> 01:00:39,954
Wind Taro

1443
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:40,464
told to

1444
01:00:40,644 --> 01:00:41,644
please don't

1445
01:00:42,086 --> 01:00:43,086
Could I ask the reason

1446
01:00:44,004 --> 01:00:45,564
i don't want to be disappointed

1447
01:00:46,764 --> 01:00:49,584
Mr. Uesugi has always tried to do the right thing

1448
01:00:50,004 --> 01:00:51,954
I was obsessed with useless things

1449
01:00:52,494 --> 01:00:53,304
meaningless 6

1450
01:00:53,304 --> 01:00:54,304
was a year

1451
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:56,484
he is of no use

1452
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:58,278
only trouble

1453
01:00:59,424 --> 01:01:00,671
what is the meaning of my existence

1454
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:02,614
Is that all

1455
01:01:06,354 --> 01:01:07,434
i am meaningless

1456
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:09,174
I don't need someone

1457
01:01:09,324 --> 01:01:11,544
i know someone who said something similar

1458
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:14,364
and that person is now

1459
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,434
I'm starting to walk forward

1460
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:18,474
you from the past

1461
01:01:18,744 --> 01:01:19,794
so that I can step forward

1462
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:21,934
large

1463
01:01:22,434 --> 01:01:23,434
Mr. Uesugi

1464
01:01:23,874 --> 01:01:24,874
let me beat

1465
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:26,164
I have to go

1466
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:27,754
say what

1467
01:01:28,224 --> 01:01:29,571
everyone's home now

1468
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:30,644
Who

1469
01:01:30,971 --> 01:01:31,074
Say

1470
01:01:31,374 --> 01:01:32,374
avoid the

1471
01:01:34,134 --> 01:01:36,024
Not just for outsiders

1472
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:38,634
Since then, I have taken on many

1473
01:01:39,084 --> 01:01:40,584
people who annoyed

1474
01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:43,114
Me

1475
01:01:45,354 --> 01:01:46,354
but elected

1476
01:01:47,844 --> 01:01:50,004
It is said to be completely quiet until tomorrow

1477
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:52,194
I'm not going to go to high school

1478
01:01:53,754 --> 01:01:54,832
sit down

1479
01:01:56,064 --> 01:01:57,064
I'll let you go

1480
01:01:57,594 --> 01:01:59,990
What happened at the school festival when you were gone

1481
01:02:02,424 --> 01:02:03,424
Our company

1482
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:05,124
one

1483
01:02:05,454 --> 01:02:07,134
You're the head of the Japan track and field club.

1484
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:09,444
I wanted to meet you

1485
01:02:10,164 --> 01:02:12,054
It seems that I have been watching since yesterday's performance

1486
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:13,074
but

1487
01:02:13,494 --> 01:02:15,474
this costume play me

1488
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:17,484
i remember these two

1489
01:02:19,014 --> 01:02:19,674
Bliss

1490
01:02:19,884 --> 01:02:20,884
two people of

1491
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:21,684
Maybe

1492
01:02:22,104 --> 01:02:23,664
did you share the content?

1493
01:02:25,824 --> 01:02:27,054
It's not just these two

1494
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,914
did you get hurt

1495
01:02:34,134 --> 01:02:35,134
it's your fault

1496
01:02:35,514 --> 01:02:36,514
not

1497
01:02:37,104 --> 01:02:39,504
I'm here for you

1498
01:02:41,454 --> 01:02:42,594
hold and hold

1499
01:02:42,864 --> 01:02:43,864
is

1500
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:46,014
I wish I could have you once in a while

1501
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:47,268
tags

1502
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:47,634
Willing to

1503
01:02:48,234 --> 01:02:49,914
I'm the one who took care of you

1504
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:57,024
We apologize for the inconvenience this time.

1505
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,774
Last day

1506
01:02:59,244 --> 01:03:00,528
work for me

1507
01:03:00,894 --> 01:03:02,034
please

1508
01:03:03,084 --> 01:03:03,324
Oh

1509
01:03:03,774 --> 01:03:04,774
Leave it to me

1510
01:03:16,254 --> 01:03:17,274
Futaro Uesugi

1511
01:03:20,154 --> 01:03:21,624
It's been a while

1512
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:24,654
I'm tired from many things today

1513
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:27,324
do it later

1514
01:03:29,274 --> 01:03:31,734
Thank you for remembering your absolute promise

1515
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:34,374
i couldn't protect

1516
01:03:35,424 --> 01:03:36,424
Sorry

1517
01:03:37,404 --> 01:03:38,964
i don't care about that

1518
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:41,604
Taro don't care

1519
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:45,324
more important than the past

1520
01:03:45,684 --> 01:03:46,684
now

1521
01:03:52,884 --> 01:03:54,564
I don't rely on my memories with you

1522
01:03:55,764 --> 01:03:57,894
Difficulty finding one's own value

1523
01:03:59,514 --> 01:04:00,514
that's why

1524
01:04:01,674 --> 01:04:02,674
this is the last

1525
01:04:03,744 --> 01:04:10,914
hmm

1526
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:16,944
Awesome

1527
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:18,294
dreamed a little

1528
01:04:19,254 --> 01:04:21,234
It's because of a lot of things that happened during the school festival.

1529
01:04:27,504 --> 01:04:28,614
dare to

1530
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:31,434
you let me do it

1531
01:04:32,274 --> 01:04:33,654
It's the last memory

1532
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:37,674
It's not the time to drag the past forever

1533
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:41,514
I feel like I'm moving forward

1534
01:04:44,637 --> 01:04:45,637
and

1535
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:00,607
this is

1536
01:05:01,254 --> 01:05:02,754
I want to confirm Asahi High School

1537
01:05:03,054 --> 01:05:04,054
in the item

1538
01:05:04,524 --> 01:05:04,704
at

1539
01:05:04,854 --> 01:05:06,204
win win also ends

1540
01:05:15,534 --> 01:05:16,534
you

1541
01:05:19,284 --> 01:05:20,994
That section was taken care of

1542
01:05:21,624 --> 01:05:22,624
Anyway

1543
01:05:22,854 --> 01:05:23,154
come

1544
01:05:23,394 --> 01:05:26,304
I can't believe I'm studying in such a festival

1545
01:05:26,784 --> 01:05:27,784
Kana

1546
01:05:28,977 --> 01:05:29,977
oh dear

1547
01:05:30,114 --> 01:05:31,254
enter university

1548
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:31,734
teacher

1549
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:32,854
I want to aim for

1550
01:05:33,744 --> 01:05:35,535
The same road as my longing mother

1551
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,634
my mother is also a school teacher

1552
01:05:39,054 --> 01:05:40,054
Know

1553
01:05:40,344 --> 01:05:40,463
hey

1554
01:05:41,064 --> 01:05:43,314
I was her homeroom teacher

1555
01:05:44,664 --> 01:05:47,498
you look just like your mom when she was young

1556
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:49,171
just like

1557
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:52,435
distorted

1558
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:57,924
She longed for me and proceeded to a teaching career that didn't suit her

1559
01:05:58,674 --> 01:06:01,284
I want to regret that until the end

1560
01:06:02,814 --> 01:06:03,924
my life

1561
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:06,234
I was just wrong

1562
01:06:07,584 --> 01:06:10,434
if you're just following your mother

1563
01:06:10,764 --> 01:06:10,914
Oh

1564
01:06:10,914 --> 01:06:11,334
Recommend

1565
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,334
do not do

1566
01:06:13,794 --> 01:06:14,794
brother

1567
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:15,714
Fire at store

1568
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:16,584
it's true that there was

1569
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:16,860
teeth

1570
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:18,174
That

1571
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:19,644
Was there anyone injured?

1572
01:06:20,154 --> 01:06:21,294
don't ride it

1573
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:23,604
by the way hood

1574
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:23,874
tower

1575
01:06:24,354 --> 01:06:26,398
Didn't you see Omin around the school?

1576
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:27,904
of

1577
01:06:28,093 --> 01:06:28,344
Nano

1578
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:28,794
father

1579
01:06:28,914 --> 01:06:29,664
all day today

1580
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:30,784
because you said

1581
01:06:31,344 --> 01:06:32,454
I couldn't see the six sounds

1582
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:35,424
the beard is soft

1583
01:06:36,114 --> 01:06:37,114
of

1584
01:06:37,434 --> 01:06:39,887
An old man who seems to ride on the face even if it is upside down

1585
01:06:41,574 --> 01:06:42,954
I'm glad you came

1586
01:06:43,765 --> 01:06:45,058
what happened after that

1587
01:06:46,284 --> 01:06:48,774
maybe i should tell you too

1588
01:06:49,914 --> 01:06:50,914
that man

1589
01:06:52,794 --> 01:06:53,964
what is your business

1590
01:06:55,104 --> 01:06:58,044
I wonder if he was wondering when to tell you

1591
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:01,254
your mother is a former student

1592
01:07:01,794 --> 01:07:03,294
Plus her ex-colleague

1593
01:07:03,744 --> 01:07:04,744
and

1594
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,354
she is ex-wife

1595
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:08,454
i mean i

1596
01:07:08,844 --> 01:07:10,374
it's your dad

1597
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:12,904
Mr. Miss

1598
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:15,408
i've always wanted to see you

1599
01:07:16,104 --> 01:07:18,684
When I was protecting the whole country as a lecturer, I always

1600
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:21,684
I was thinking of you somewhere

1601
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:23,704
when that happens

1602
01:07:23,964 --> 01:07:24,324
tv set

1603
01:07:24,324 --> 01:07:26,424
I saw Ichika-chan reflected in

1604
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:29,514
Now it's time to enter the castle as a father

1605
01:07:29,904 --> 01:07:30,904
Is not it

1606
01:07:31,104 --> 01:07:33,144
I heard about you from your mother

1607
01:07:34,014 --> 01:07:36,773
As soon as I found out that the children in my womb were quintuplets

1608
01:07:37,014 --> 01:07:38,064
she disappeared

1609
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:39,774
That time

1610
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:41,724
what was her mother like

1611
01:07:42,984 --> 01:07:43,984
i love you

1612
01:07:45,024 --> 01:07:46,024
sorry

1613
01:07:46,494 --> 01:07:48,233
let me atone for my sins

1614
01:07:48,804 --> 01:07:49,554
from now on

1615
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:52,224
As a father, I want to do what I can for my daughter.

1616
01:07:54,084 --> 01:07:55,823
don't get involved with us

1617
01:07:56,964 --> 01:07:58,224
I have a father

1618
01:07:59,244 --> 01:08:00,244
Nakano-kun

1619
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:02,724
when mom died

1620
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:04,914
let me introduce this to you

1621
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:07,254
her daughter

1622
01:08:07,494 --> 01:08:09,804
follow the shadow of her late mother

1623
01:08:10,134 --> 01:08:13,854
I'm dropping advice on the same wrong path as my mother

1624
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:18,474
that your school teacher is not right for you

1625
01:08:18,834 --> 01:08:21,504
you should know best

1626
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:27,804
The love for you that I cannot overlook as a father

1627
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,574
pushed me

1628
01:08:34,335 --> 01:08:34,584
valuable

1629
01:08:35,334 --> 01:08:36,334
na

1630
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:37,504
how to say

1631
01:08:37,854 --> 01:08:39,234
Was it the same as usual?

1632
01:08:39,864 --> 01:08:40,206
Raw

1633
01:08:40,344 --> 01:08:42,952
It's been a while so I don't know why

1634
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:45,174
your ex father

1635
01:08:45,924 --> 01:08:47,664
There is a suspicion that he had contact with Itsuki.

1636
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:53,722
Hmm

1637
01:08:55,494 --> 01:08:56,843
Itsuki can't listen

1638
01:08:57,324 --> 01:08:58,944
Even though today was the last day

1639
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:00,574
what's wrong

1640
01:09:01,044 --> 01:09:02,964
I've been stuck in my room since yesterday

1641
01:09:03,984 --> 01:09:04,984
artificial flowers

1642
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:06,604
Wait

1643
01:09:07,614 --> 01:09:07,794
2

1644
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:08,904
you're going to the moon

1645
01:09:09,594 --> 01:09:10,594
take it

1646
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,247
is it ok

1647
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:13,884
That's why you're my husband

1648
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:15,654
i like that place

1649
01:09:16,314 --> 01:09:17,574
leave this to me

1650
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:19,584
You Itsuki

1651
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:27,495
Hmm

1652
01:09:29,424 --> 01:09:30,424
you

1653
01:09:31,644 --> 01:09:32,644
sleeping too much

1654
01:09:33,084 --> 01:09:35,184
Even though this doesn't mean anything

1655
01:09:35,514 --> 01:09:37,042
what am i doing

1656
01:09:38,214 --> 01:09:40,314
Don't worry about that mountain

1657
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:44,094
Even though I'm saying something appropriate anyway, the foreign mother also said

1658
01:09:45,209 --> 01:09:46,209
Moon

1659
01:09:46,734 --> 01:09:49,644
you should never be like me

1660
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,264
But I can't give up

1661
01:09:55,584 --> 01:09:57,220
I'm aiming for your mother

1662
01:09:59,514 --> 01:10:00,514
I

1663
01:10:01,254 --> 01:10:01,704
I wonder if there is

1664
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:02,824
mosquito

1665
01:10:03,564 --> 01:10:04,564
Is that so

1666
01:10:05,454 --> 01:10:07,344
There's no point in becoming a teacher

1667
01:10:09,264 --> 01:10:11,484
Not all good students

1668
01:10:11,964 --> 01:10:12,654
in the world

1669
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:15,624
I am reminded that there is an unimaginable idiot

1670
01:10:16,434 --> 01:10:17,364
my policy

1671
01:10:17,364 --> 01:10:18,024
even if you bend

1672
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:20,004
have to get along

1673
01:10:21,024 --> 01:10:22,253
are involved with others

1674
01:10:22,614 --> 01:10:24,924
There is no doubt that you will be tired both physically and mentally

1675
01:10:26,844 --> 01:10:28,483
Some students will rebel

1676
01:10:29,274 --> 01:10:32,724
Even at times like that, I have to let you run away and keep facing each other

1677
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:33,924
Really

1678
01:10:33,924 --> 01:10:34,924
it was hard

1679
01:10:35,454 --> 01:10:36,710
I'm tired

1680
01:10:37,344 --> 01:10:39,500
I will never become a teacher

1681
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,364
but what happened

1682
01:10:42,024 --> 01:10:44,034
It's not worth listening to all the nonsense

1683
01:10:44,664 --> 01:10:45,664
it's your dream

1684
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:47,584
how much headwind

1685
01:10:47,724 --> 01:10:47,844
But

1686
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:50,484
You decide whether to proceed or not

1687
01:10:52,494 --> 01:10:53,874
is it my dream

1688
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:56,694
i just want to be a mom

1689
01:10:57,774 --> 01:10:58,104
Before

1690
01:10:58,795 --> 01:11:00,474
I have been told by someone

1691
01:11:01,554 --> 01:11:03,264
Aiming for her mother and chasing her dreams

1692
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:06,474
It's very different from chasing your mother for your dreams

1693
01:11:07,824 --> 01:11:09,684
if you can understand that

1694
01:11:10,374 --> 01:11:11,374
longing for parents

1695
01:11:11,574 --> 01:11:12,574
to aspire to

1696
01:11:12,924 --> 01:11:14,274
definitely not wrong

1697
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:17,044
I

1698
01:11:18,414 --> 01:11:19,414
I

1699
01:11:20,274 --> 01:11:21,274
will be

1700
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,810
I am me

1701
01:11:26,155 --> 01:11:27,414
if students want

1702
01:11:28,074 --> 01:11:30,444
There's only one thing I can do as a tutor

1703
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,214
full support

1704
01:11:32,214 --> 01:11:32,447
do

1705
01:11:33,144 --> 01:11:34,144
That's it

1706
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,934
I came up with a way to say

1707
01:11:41,904 --> 01:11:42,904
weather

1708
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:44,079
please tell me

1709
01:11:45,624 --> 01:11:46,624
maybe

1710
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:48,604
thank you

1711
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,018
It's

1712
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:57,054
I have to do something

1713
01:12:01,794 --> 01:12:02,334
today

1714
01:12:02,754 --> 01:12:03,754
woman teacher

1715
01:12:04,764 --> 01:12:05,764
world

1716
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:10,374
I don't think Itsuki-chan will come.

1717
01:12:11,154 --> 01:12:15,024
I learned to listen to my father's words

1718
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,644
Is it okay to say

1719
01:12:19,104 --> 01:12:20,214
even my father

1720
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:21,334
don't make me laugh

1721
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,254
You and

1722
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:25,763
long time no see teacher

1723
01:12:27,354 --> 01:12:29,544
We're not the ones who need it

1724
01:12:31,884 --> 01:12:32,884
Mr. Mudo

1725
01:12:34,194 --> 01:12:34,584
abusive language

1726
01:12:34,886 --> 01:12:34,998
When

1727
01:12:35,708 --> 01:12:36,708
of

1728
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:39,924
I'm glad I got a chance to apologize even for the subtleties

1729
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:42,744
I put a lot of effort into Nakano Ward.

1730
01:12:45,744 --> 01:12:46,744
it wasn't down

1731
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,884
thank you

1732
01:12:51,084 --> 01:12:53,154
your irresponsible behavior

1733
01:12:53,274 --> 01:12:55,494
bring me and my daughters together

1734
01:12:56,214 --> 01:12:57,214
how are people

1735
01:12:57,654 --> 01:12:59,604
with regards to responsibility

1736
01:12:59,724 --> 01:13:01,764
it looks like you can't do it either

1737
01:13:02,934 --> 01:13:05,364
That's why Itsuki-chan came here voluntarily

1738
01:13:05,724 --> 01:13:07,134
not the unreliable you

1739
01:13:07,374 --> 01:13:07,765
Bork

1740
01:13:07,765 --> 01:13:08,765
she is at

1741
01:13:09,354 --> 01:13:10,674
Itsuki-kun is here

1742
01:13:12,384 --> 01:13:13,944
what is he saying

1743
01:13:15,714 --> 01:13:16,824
take a good look

1744
01:13:17,514 --> 01:13:19,284
It would be nice to have Itsuki-kun at the airport

1745
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,444
i am here

1746
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,816
what do you mean

1747
01:13:27,534 --> 01:13:28,534
deceived

1748
01:13:28,644 --> 01:13:29,644
excuse me

1749
01:13:29,904 --> 01:13:30,234
but

1750
01:13:30,564 --> 01:13:32,034
i knew it was going to happen

1751
01:13:32,694 --> 01:13:34,074
What about it

1752
01:13:34,344 --> 01:13:36,234
I was just wrong

1753
01:13:36,924 --> 01:13:39,084
love can distinguish us

1754
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:41,584
mother's words

1755
01:13:43,134 --> 01:13:44,694
is it about her again

1756
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:46,164
come on

1757
01:13:46,314 --> 01:13:49,524
How long are you going to believe in such irrelevant rants?

1758
01:13:50,184 --> 01:13:51,954
forget now

1759
01:13:52,134 --> 01:13:53,274
so is your mother

1760
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:54,394
it shouldn't be

1761
01:13:54,449 --> 01:13:57,414
she remember what she said

1762
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:01,644
she said her mother had her regrets

1763
01:14:01,794 --> 01:14:02,794
she remembers

1764
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:03,894
is

1765
01:14:04,074 --> 01:14:05,634
your mother was wrong

1766
01:14:05,814 --> 01:14:07,254
you will be

1767
01:14:07,435 --> 01:14:09,024
i don't think so

1768
01:14:10,584 --> 01:14:11,784
even if really

1769
01:14:12,174 --> 01:14:14,454
her mom denied her own life

1770
01:14:14,844 --> 01:14:16,254
i denied it

1771
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:18,034
OK

1772
01:14:18,174 --> 01:14:19,824
am i not a mom

1773
01:14:20,904 --> 01:14:21,954
she has seen it

1774
01:14:22,734 --> 01:14:24,534
she gave up everything

1775
01:14:25,284 --> 01:14:26,284
mother figure

1776
01:14:27,354 --> 01:14:28,974
The life of such a kind person

1777
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,954
can't be wrong

1778
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,264
blurry

1779
01:14:33,586 --> 01:14:37,254
Hey, you speak like you know me.

1780
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:39,893
then she has her children

1781
01:14:40,674 --> 01:14:43,614
You don't know how much hope I've found on your face

1782
01:14:44,797 --> 01:14:46,884
you're not qualified to talk about her

1783
01:14:50,274 --> 01:14:51,274
she is a woman

1784
01:14:51,834 --> 01:14:52,914
from you to the end

1785
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:55,764
There was no word of apology to her mom

1786
01:14:58,344 --> 01:15:00,024
i won't forgive you

1787
01:15:00,534 --> 01:15:02,244
I won't be a can of atonement

1788
01:15:02,784 --> 01:15:05,274
The day will never come when you will be free from your mother

1789
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:08,784
I've come all the way

1790
01:15:09,594 --> 01:15:10,594
unsightly

1791
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:11,674
uncle

1792
01:15:21,504 --> 01:15:21,774
and

1793
01:15:22,404 --> 01:15:23,505
did you get it all done

1794
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,134
it's you

1795
01:15:26,844 --> 01:15:28,044
I saw you from below

1796
01:15:28,884 --> 01:15:29,884
hey

1797
01:15:30,018 --> 01:15:30,167
hey

1798
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:30,594
mosquito

1799
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,194
thank you

1800
01:15:33,444 --> 01:15:34,794
since mom died

1801
01:15:35,544 --> 01:15:37,074
to fill her loneliness

1802
01:15:37,464 --> 01:15:39,354
was trying to impersonate her mother

1803
01:15:40,644 --> 01:15:41,644
Before I knew it

1804
01:15:41,844 --> 01:15:44,724
The line between myself and my mother became blurred.

1805
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:46,494
even my dreams

1806
01:15:47,094 --> 01:15:48,804
I lost my confidence

1807
01:15:51,174 --> 01:15:52,174
Me

1808
01:15:52,554 --> 01:15:53,327
mom

1809
01:15:53,544 --> 01:15:54,544
I don't have to

1810
01:15:57,834 --> 01:15:59,190
Nigate was the one who taught me

1811
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,190
is

1812
01:16:01,104 --> 01:16:02,104
thank you

1813
01:16:06,504 --> 01:16:09,024
The sky is getting so dark all of a sudden

1814
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:10,104
Ma

1815
01:16:10,104 --> 01:16:11,104
It's winter

1816
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:12,413
eh

1817
01:16:12,974 --> 01:16:13,974
eh

1818
01:16:14,156 --> 01:16:15,156
eh

1819
01:16:16,164 --> 01:16:16,404
Chan

1820
01:16:16,565 --> 01:16:17,565
I passed

1821
01:16:17,604 --> 01:16:18,624
i feel sick

1822
01:16:18,954 --> 01:16:19,954
this is the case

1823
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:20,904
sorry

1824
01:16:21,234 --> 01:16:22,234
anyway

1825
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:24,894
It is thanks to you that I was able to have confidence

1826
01:16:25,854 --> 01:16:27,264
i'm not a mom

1827
01:16:27,774 --> 01:16:29,844
I just noticed something so simple

1828
01:16:30,384 --> 01:16:31,384
because you were there

1829
01:16:33,084 --> 01:16:34,884
my ideal teacher

1830
01:16:35,034 --> 01:16:36,145
stay with mom

1831
01:16:37,494 --> 01:16:38,494
nothing

1832
01:16:40,524 --> 01:16:41,524
in short

1833
01:16:42,384 --> 01:16:43,384
Uesugi-kun

1834
01:16:44,154 --> 01:16:45,953
you are my ideal

1835
01:16:47,634 --> 01:16:48,984
how much i wanted to hear

1836
01:16:53,244 --> 01:16:54,244
yes

1837
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:01,792
Mr. Nakano and others

1838
01:17:02,424 --> 01:17:03,424
Sorry I made you wait

1839
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:07,734
It was Itsukishima

1840
01:17:08,304 --> 01:17:10,164
I was told that it was that child by Fuutarou-kun

1841
01:17:11,754 --> 01:17:14,004
I could also say thank you to his father.

1842
01:17:14,814 --> 01:17:16,344
to everyone again i

1843
01:17:17,064 --> 01:17:17,544
good good

1844
01:17:17,664 --> 01:17:17,952
world

1845
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,544
It was also a problem for our family.

1846
01:17:23,876 --> 01:17:24,876
can be

1847
01:17:25,614 --> 01:17:26,614
gatou

1848
01:17:27,385 --> 01:17:28,824
there is nothing but discomfort

1849
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:34,224
Mikuni was even disguised

1850
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:35,644
I do not care

1851
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:36,264
in addition

1852
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:38,844
I'm not satisfied with Honatsu's disguise

1853
01:17:39,145 --> 01:17:41,186
This child is this child with a mysterious pride

1854
01:17:41,186 --> 01:17:42,186
is also sprouting

1855
01:17:43,014 --> 01:17:45,594
Ordinary people just get it wrong

1856
01:17:46,224 --> 01:17:48,354
Even if the contents change, the face remains the same

1857
01:17:51,564 --> 01:17:53,874
How long will we be quintuplets

1858
01:18:00,594 --> 01:18:02,904
There's still time until the promise with Fuutarou-kun

1859
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:05,394
You can change your mood and enjoy flavored vegetables

1860
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:07,654
Hey

1861
01:18:07,939 --> 01:18:09,834
How long will I be sitting here

1862
01:18:10,734 --> 01:18:12,594
Somehow, the wind blows in the sky

1863
01:18:13,074 --> 01:18:14,074
street car

1864
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:15,514
That's right

1865
01:18:16,314 --> 01:18:17,124
keep eating

1866
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:18,124
death

1867
01:18:18,264 --> 01:18:19,825
There was a store I couldn't go to

1868
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:22,134
When it's done I

1869
01:18:23,184 --> 01:18:24,682
I promise to meet you

1870
01:18:25,224 --> 01:18:26,224
I see

1871
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:28,644
I just saw that island

1872
01:18:29,214 --> 01:18:30,534
When h-ko was also there 5

1873
01:18:30,534 --> 01:18:31,584
It was full of people.

1874
01:18:31,914 --> 01:18:32,574
Eh

1875
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:33,174
Maeda-kun

1876
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:36,054
I knew in that moment that you were a family member.

1877
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:37,370
hey

1878
01:18:37,905 --> 01:18:38,905
oh dear

1879
01:18:39,504 --> 01:18:40,504
because it's a story

1880
01:18:40,794 --> 01:18:43,254
Ichinohe-san is the only one who vaguely understands

1881
01:18:43,854 --> 01:18:45,114
Uesugi-kun is of course

1882
01:18:45,264 --> 01:18:46,264
I can tell

1883
01:18:46,734 --> 01:18:47,734
Hey

1884
01:18:48,384 --> 01:18:50,364
He's not confident when you say that

1885
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:53,364
At first I was more confused than now

1886
01:18:54,384 --> 01:18:56,826
I'm not good at remembering people's faces

1887
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:58,434
Moreover

1888
01:18:59,004 --> 01:19:00,474
They take full advantage of it

1889
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:01,474
feel free to use

1890
01:19:02,574 --> 01:19:04,014
how many times have you been deceived

1891
01:19:05,304 --> 01:19:06,924
They were in trouble until the end

1892
01:19:07,854 --> 01:19:08,004
from

1893
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:09,244
the style of drawing

1894
01:19:09,804 --> 01:19:11,244
I suddenly wondered

1895
01:19:12,024 --> 01:19:15,415
Now you can tell from which of them

1896
01:19:18,622 --> 01:19:19,014
good

1897
01:19:19,344 --> 01:19:20,344
Yatai go

1898
01:19:21,774 --> 01:19:22,795
wait

1899
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:24,324
as it is now

1900
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:26,724
Takeda what's going on

1901
01:19:26,904 --> 01:19:28,134
What do you mean

1902
01:19:28,284 --> 01:19:29,784
Isn't it the climate for Uesugi-kun?

1903
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:31,234
etc.

1904
01:19:31,944 --> 01:19:36,294
Uesugi-kun, don't hide the secrets among us

1905
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:37,505
hand

1906
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:38,844
if beautiful

1907
01:19:38,898 --> 01:19:39,898
Hey

1908
01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:40,524
Like

1909
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:40,718
of

1910
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:42,594
someone from the quintuplets

1911
01:19:47,064 --> 01:19:48,804
A student's duty is to study

1912
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:53,514
Because I lived believing that everything else was unnecessary

1913
01:19:54,114 --> 01:19:56,124
I didn't need to throw anything else away

1914
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:58,444
We also study

1915
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,654
Work entertainment and romance

1916
01:20:01,374 --> 01:20:03,084
They're always full pitchers

1917
01:20:05,244 --> 01:20:06,244
I'm stuck

1918
01:20:06,534 --> 01:20:08,364
A series of people taught me that

1919
01:20:09,954 --> 01:20:11,934
Until I realized just that

1920
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,124
I've kept you waiting until now

1921
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:17,154
If I'm still the same as I used to be

1922
01:20:18,174 --> 01:20:20,064
I wonder if I was alone at this moment

1923
01:20:22,224 --> 01:20:23,224
Uesugi

1924
01:20:23,727 --> 01:20:24,174
good

1925
01:20:24,624 --> 01:20:25,624
Shall we go to the food stalls then?

1926
01:20:26,334 --> 01:20:26,640
curry

1927
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:26,994
take it

1928
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:27,994
but

1929
01:20:28,047 --> 01:20:29,047
hey

1930
01:20:29,747 --> 01:20:31,646
So I'm going to the stall

1931
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:33,566
the shape really helps

1932
01:20:34,318 --> 01:20:35,318
Already

1933
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,206
It has been decided

1934
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:40,346
To enjoy this festival until the end

1935
01:20:45,326 --> 01:20:46,616
It's almost time

1936
01:21:02,966 --> 01:21:05,996
Ken UesugiWhen everything ends today

1937
01:21:06,776 --> 01:21:07,776
we

1938
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,116
in each room

1939
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:11,426
while holding each other's thoughts

1940
01:21:12,086 --> 01:21:13,256
I'm waiting for you

1941
01:21:17,846 --> 01:21:19,046
you're going

1942
01:21:19,676 --> 01:21:21,056
only one classroom

1943
01:21:23,846 --> 01:21:24,846
this proposal

1944
01:21:25,376 --> 01:21:28,196
I know it will get you in trouble

1945
01:21:29,486 --> 01:21:30,926
this is our resolution

1946
01:21:32,456 --> 01:21:33,456
please

1947
01:21:33,626 --> 01:21:34,976
please understand that

1948
01:21:40,466 --> 01:21:40,736
this

1949
01:21:40,884 --> 01:21:41,032
To

1950
01:21:41,516 --> 01:21:42,201
red mark

1951
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:43,201
each committee

1952
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:44,316
alumni association

1953
01:21:44,835 --> 01:21:45,835
It depends on the day of

1954
01:21:45,986 --> 01:21:46,108
9

1955
01:21:46,108 --> 01:21:47,108
before the hour

1956
01:21:52,852 --> 01:21:55,376
Hmm

1957
01:21:59,437 --> 01:22:01,475
Hmm

1958
01:22:02,186 --> 01:22:03,186
exaggeration

1959
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:04,985
chau

1960
01:22:05,456 --> 01:22:06,456
Kun

1961
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,498
Hmm

1962
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,360
world

1963
01:22:20,456 --> 01:22:21,456
in some cases

1964
01:22:22,046 --> 01:22:23,786
I made up my mind

1965
01:22:35,636 --> 01:22:36,636
from now on

1966
01:22:37,136 --> 01:22:38,136
Ken Uesugi

1967
01:22:47,756 --> 01:22:48,756
world

1968
01:22:54,296 --> 01:22:55,296
I made you wait

1969
01:22:57,536 --> 01:22:57,896
is

1970
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,106
why are you here

1971
01:22:59,576 --> 01:23:00,686
I came to see you

1972
01:23:01,286 --> 01:23:01,466
world

1973
01:23:01,586 --> 01:23:02,586
Hey

1974
01:23:03,806 --> 01:23:04,196
Lie

1975
01:23:04,556 --> 01:23:05,556
is

1976
01:23:09,626 --> 01:23:10,766
this is impossible

1977
01:23:11,545 --> 01:23:12,545
It's okay

1978
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:14,366
why did this happen

1979
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:15,865
2

1980
01:23:15,896 --> 01:23:17,638
but I turned quite a lot

1981
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:19,646
why weren't you here

1982
01:23:20,486 --> 01:23:21,486
Because

1983
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:23,066
come to me

1984
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:26,006
I bought freshly made

1985
01:23:28,406 --> 01:23:30,026
It's the voucher you gave me

1986
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:31,376
village

1987
01:23:32,096 --> 01:23:32,396
square

1988
01:23:32,396 --> 01:23:32,456
of

1989
01:23:33,086 --> 01:23:34,556
I've been waiting for you

1990
01:23:36,806 --> 01:23:38,366
I decided to be you and the sky here

1991
01:23:40,253 --> 01:23:44,277
Hmm

1992
01:23:45,357 --> 01:23:46,357
So

1993
01:23:47,816 --> 01:23:49,556
After getting this result

1994
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,056
I will listen

1995
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:52,626
You are

1996
01:23:52,706 --> 01:23:53,706
sorry

1997
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:00,080
here we go

1998
01:24:00,513 --> 01:24:01,513
Mr. Miss

1999
01:24:04,346 --> 01:24:06,296
Even so, I've gathered courage

2000
01:24:06,806 --> 01:24:08,456
If it is said that there is a shortage

2001
01:24:12,086 --> 01:24:13,404
Mr. Uesugi is me

2002
01:24:13,522 --> 01:24:14,846
is very

2003
01:24:15,326 --> 01:24:16,326
What is it

2004
01:24:18,506 --> 01:24:18,686
actual

2005
01:24:18,806 --> 01:24:19,076
for

2006
01:24:19,286 --> 01:24:19,646
better

2007
01:24:19,766 --> 01:24:20,426
there must be people

2008
01:24:20,546 --> 01:24:20,666
is

2009
01:24:20,966 --> 01:24:21,296
Me

2010
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:22,796
I want to fit in somehow

2011
01:24:22,976 --> 01:24:23,976
do not have

2012
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:25,976
What does it mean

2013
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:27,056
this

2014
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:27,356
teeth

2015
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,776
not me

2016
01:24:28,946 --> 01:24:29,186
Everyone

2017
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:29,426
of

2018
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:29,786
But

2019
01:24:30,476 --> 01:24:31,476
Everyone

2020
01:24:34,226 --> 01:24:36,115
i'm listening to you now

2021
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,146
tell me how you feel

2022
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:44,556
That bastard

2023
01:24:52,316 --> 01:24:53,316
made use of

2024
01:24:53,906 --> 01:24:54,906
Uesugi-kun

2025
01:24:56,426 --> 01:24:57,426
Itsuki

2026
01:24:57,476 --> 01:24:58,476
They

2027
01:24:58,766 --> 01:25:01,196
I tried to run to my unlucky mother

2028
01:25:02,426 --> 01:25:04,676
There should be one place you should go

2029
01:25:06,716 --> 01:25:08,816
Excessive care only hurts

2030
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:12,546
That's right

2031
01:25:13,076 --> 01:25:14,076
Suma

2032
01:25:17,906 --> 01:25:18,906
Yotsuba

2033
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:20,666
she always said

2034
01:25:21,446 --> 01:25:22,446
again and again

2035
01:25:22,976 --> 01:25:23,976
Persistent

2036
01:25:25,691 --> 01:25:26,691
do not have

2037
01:25:26,994 --> 01:25:27,206
increase

2038
01:25:27,356 --> 01:25:28,356
Hey

2039
01:25:28,496 --> 01:25:30,506
I invite you to a school trip that will never happen this time

2040
01:25:32,036 --> 01:25:32,276
1

2041
01:25:32,276 --> 01:25:32,516
mm

2042
01:25:32,516 --> 01:25:33,516
from regret

2043
01:25:33,596 --> 01:25:34,646
don't make it a school festival

2044
01:25:36,176 --> 01:25:37,286
Then don't give up

2045
01:25:39,116 --> 01:25:41,396
ah

2046
01:25:43,136 --> 01:25:43,376
Like

2047
01:25:43,886 --> 01:25:44,886
now

2048
01:25:44,936 --> 01:25:45,476
to

2049
01:25:45,836 --> 01:25:46,038
teeth

2050
01:25:46,325 --> 01:25:46,616
the typhoon is

2051
01:25:47,097 --> 01:25:47,209
rice field

2052
01:25:47,816 --> 01:25:50,006
I can't be the only one special

2053
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:52,226
Me

2054
01:25:52,346 --> 01:25:53,346
Something

2055
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:08,196
This is Fuchu

2056
01:26:08,336 --> 01:26:08,726
was

2057
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:10,296
excuse me

2058
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:14,876
for now

2059
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:15,386
bus

2060
01:26:15,386 --> 01:26:16,386
do you want to ride home

2061
01:26:19,286 --> 01:26:20,576
keep the way it opens

2062
01:26:21,144 --> 01:26:22,166
everyone used it

2063
01:26:24,716 --> 01:26:26,456
Let me tell you what I have

2064
01:26:26,756 --> 01:26:28,196
this 200 yen

2065
01:26:28,586 --> 01:26:29,606
don't lend

2066
01:26:30,836 --> 01:26:31,836
I know it

2067
01:26:32,576 --> 01:26:33,576
Be careful

2068
01:26:42,626 --> 01:26:43,706
it's gone

2069
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:45,926
orange

2070
01:26:45,926 --> 01:26:46,926
in poverty

2071
01:26:47,156 --> 01:26:47,816
5 every time

2072
01:26:47,816 --> 01:26:48,816
it's a yen

2073
01:26:49,196 --> 01:26:50,196
I'm strong

2074
01:26:51,337 --> 01:26:53,576
It's not hard without money

2075
01:26:54,233 --> 01:26:54,536
Hmm

2076
01:26:54,656 --> 01:26:55,656
What does it mean

2077
01:26:56,456 --> 01:26:56,846
master

2078
01:26:56,846 --> 01:26:57,236
number

2079
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:57,566
Hey

2080
01:26:58,316 --> 01:26:59,336
for the family

2081
01:26:59,546 --> 01:27:01,816
Your mother works alone

2082
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:03,456
so

2083
01:27:03,896 --> 01:27:04,946
I sometimes think

2084
01:27:06,056 --> 01:27:07,076
I need a lot number

2085
01:27:07,616 --> 01:27:09,108
she was happy with her mother

2086
01:27:11,486 --> 01:27:12,486
because she

2087
01:27:12,536 --> 01:27:14,126
she will study a lot

2088
01:27:14,966 --> 01:27:15,966
she got smarter

2089
01:27:16,256 --> 01:27:16,796
Exceptional

2090
01:27:16,975 --> 01:27:17,674
lightweight manners

2091
01:27:17,674 --> 01:27:18,746
Join a company that gives

2092
01:27:19,257 --> 01:27:19,932
mother is

2093
01:27:20,246 --> 01:27:21,246
let me

2094
01:27:22,016 --> 01:27:23,016
then surely

2095
01:27:23,306 --> 01:27:25,676
I think there's meaning in me

2096
01:27:26,818 --> 01:27:27,818
Awesome

2097
01:27:28,527 --> 01:27:29,666
such as pretone

2098
01:27:30,686 --> 01:27:31,686
Various

2099
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,386
I study hard too

2100
01:27:33,536 --> 01:27:34,554
get smarter

2101
01:27:34,886 --> 01:27:36,416
when you start making money

2102
01:27:36,896 --> 01:27:39,952
I might be able to let my little sister live a comfortable life.

2103
01:27:40,436 --> 01:27:42,626
I wonder if I can become a necessary person

2104
01:27:47,156 --> 01:27:48,156
Man

2105
01:27:48,223 --> 01:27:48,834
we are mother

2106
01:27:48,986 --> 01:27:49,986

2107
01:27:50,812 --> 01:27:51,512
mother sister

2109
01:27:52,766 --> 01:27:53,964
study hard

2110
01:27:55,716 --> 01:28:00,104
Hmm

2111
01:28:01,346 --> 01:28:03,048
100 yen each for me and you

2112
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:04,741
thank you god

2113
01:28:05,936 --> 01:28:05,996
Hmm

2114
01:28:06,101 --> 01:28:10,976
Hmm

2115
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:25,416
four leaves

2116
01:28:27,236 --> 01:28:28,236
that ribbon

2117
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:29,436
you look good

2118
01:28:30,626 --> 01:28:31,626
Thank you

2119
01:28:32,667 --> 01:28:34,586
I can't be mistaken for everyone

2120
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:35,636
here we go

2121
01:28:36,026 --> 01:28:37,026
what do you think

2122
01:28:38,036 --> 01:28:39,776
what are you wearing

2123
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,366
not a big difference

2124
01:28:42,056 --> 01:28:42,326
that

2125
01:28:42,446 --> 01:28:42,926
not only

2126
01:28:43,136 --> 01:28:43,226
world

2127
01:28:43,676 --> 01:28:44,006
Me

2128
01:28:44,276 --> 01:28:45,446
learn from everyone

2129
01:28:45,806 --> 01:28:47,726
It was the best before

2130
01:28:50,486 --> 01:28:50,786
Me

2131
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,960

2132
01:28:52,106 --> 01:28:53,106

2134
01:28:59,606 --> 01:29:00,606
cute

2135
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,353
imitate them

2136
01:29:02,528 --> 01:29:02,756
want to see

2137
01:29:02,876 --> 01:29:03,876
Hey

2138
01:29:04,076 --> 01:29:05,076
Yotsuba

2139
01:29:05,216 --> 01:29:06,896
your efforts are great

2140
01:29:07,466 --> 01:29:08,846
nothing wrong

2141
01:29:09,866 --> 01:29:10,286
but

2142
01:29:10,796 --> 01:29:12,116
without being number one

2143
01:29:12,476 --> 01:29:13,256
you

2144
01:29:13,376 --> 01:29:14,846
each person is special

2145
01:29:17,546 --> 01:29:18,296
as a parent

2146
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:20,936
i want you to be with me

2147
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:24,206
no matter what happens

2148
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:27,116
it doesn't matter where you are

2149
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:28,105
5

2150
01:29:28,105 --> 01:29:29,216
to be human

2151
01:29:42,116 --> 01:29:43,116
excuse me

2152
01:29:51,536 --> 01:29:52,826
to talk like this

2153
01:29:53,006 --> 01:29:54,006
It's my first time

2154
01:29:56,306 --> 01:29:56,996
you guys

2155
01:29:57,296 --> 01:29:59,396
I take responsibility

2156
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:01,896
Mom

2157
01:30:02,576 --> 01:30:04,436
we became junior high school students

2158
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:06,966
older sister

2159
01:30:07,346 --> 01:30:08,346
together

2160
01:30:08,996 --> 01:30:09,996
Impossible

2161
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:12,006
we

2162
01:30:12,506 --> 01:30:14,006
I can no longer be the author

2163
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:18,246
previous test

2164
01:30:18,596 --> 01:30:18,806
5

2165
01:30:18,806 --> 01:30:19,806
most of people

2166
01:30:21,087 --> 01:30:22,087
well said

2167
01:30:22,376 --> 01:30:25,106
I was invited to join the track and field club, but I turned it down.

2168
01:30:25,526 --> 01:30:28,196
But I want to concentrate on my studies so it can't be helped

2169
01:30:29,096 --> 01:30:30,626
I want to encourage you

2170
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,580
Hmm

2171
01:30:34,076 --> 01:30:34,376
what

2172
01:30:34,526 --> 01:30:35,966
it's cold

2173
01:30:36,446 --> 01:30:38,996
If she was a mom, she'd give me more compliments

2174
01:30:41,246 --> 01:30:42,506
she will praise

2175
01:30:46,101 --> 01:30:47,185
Taro's present time

2176
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:49,196

2177

four leaves

2178
01:30:51,926 --> 01:30:52,946
This doesn't work either

2179
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:53,763
is

2180
01:30:54,506 --> 01:30:56,216
You'll get in the way of studying

2181
01:30:57,266 --> 01:30:58,766
May I borrow this

2182
01:31:00,863 --> 01:31:03,146
It's getting better and better

2183
01:31:03,506 --> 01:31:04,506

2184
01:31:05,366 --> 01:31:06,366

2187
01:31:08,486 --> 01:31:09,686
I scored like this

2188
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:12,086
A game borrowed from four leaves

2189
01:31:12,086 --> 01:31:13,086

Tane

2192
01:31:18,986 --> 01:31:20,096
I have to try harder

2193
01:31:20,966 --> 01:31:22,076
study a lot

2194
01:31:23,336 --> 01:31:24,336
get smarter

2195
01:31:25,196 --> 01:31:25,766
Exceptional

2196
01:31:25,946 --> 01:31:27,476
A company that pays

2197
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:32,166
I

2198
01:31:32,276 --> 01:31:34,288
what should i study for

2199
01:31:35,546 --> 01:31:38,426
The important thing that doesn't have to be special

2200
01:31:38,546 --> 01:31:38,755
5

2201
01:31:38,755 --> 01:31:39,926
because it's about being human

2202
01:31:41,335 --> 01:31:43,162
why is it important to be

2203
01:31:44,696 --> 01:31:44,996
I don't understand

2204
01:31:45,116 --> 01:31:46,116

everyone in the department

2209
01:31:56,396 --> 01:31:57,396
Mr. Miss

2210
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,840
I'm stopped by everyone

2211
01:32:00,716 --> 01:32:02,396
needed by many people

2212
01:32:03,536 --> 01:32:04,826
none of the sisters

2213
01:32:05,426 --> 01:32:05,966
Just me

2214
01:32:06,206 --> 01:32:07,206
what is it

2215
01:32:07,526 --> 01:32:10,766
Lately I've been practicing all the time, but I'm fine

2216
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:12,126
I can study

2217
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:13,939
If you'd like

2218
01:32:14,186 --> 01:32:15,686
let me tell you

2219
01:32:16,496 --> 01:32:17,496
I'm all

2220
01:32:17,546 --> 01:32:18,546
Wrong

2221
01:32:20,396 --> 01:32:21,396
won't be together

2222
01:32:22,646 --> 01:32:23,246
I

2223
01:32:23,666 --> 01:32:25,129
I'm number seven in the play

2224
01:32:26,366 --> 01:32:27,366
I wonder if it's different

2225
01:32:27,746 --> 01:32:29,306
Failed make-up exam

yes

2230
01:32:39,026 --> 01:32:39,236
is

2231
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:40,416
right

2232
01:32:40,496 --> 01:32:41,516
it's not a lie

2233
01:32:43,766 --> 01:32:43,916
only

2234
01:32:44,246 --> 01:32:45,246
Even though it was

2235
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:45,626
this

2236
01:32:45,926 --> 01:32:46,436

I should have warned you again

2239
01:32:51,386 --> 01:32:54,026
You didn't try to quit the multiple entry club

2240
01:32:54,896 --> 01:32:56,126
pack your bags

2241

an acquaintance of mine serves as director

2242
01:33:03,206 --> 01:33:04,851
at a coed school

2243
01:33:05,336 --> 01:33:06,476
From the beginning of summer vacation

2244
01:33:06,596 --> 01:33:08,396
you will go there

2245
01:33:09,656 --> 01:33:10,656
Me

2246
01:33:10,856 --> 01:33:11,856
is it

2247
01:33:13,676 --> 01:33:15,716
I should be special

2248
01:33:16,856 --> 01:33:18,806
Trying to make a meaning for me

2249
01:33:19,256 --> 01:33:20,666
I came here desperately

2250
01:33:21,416 --> 01:33:21,956
Me

2251
01:33:22,376 --> 01:33:23,376
what a single

2252
01:33:24,356 --> 01:33:25,356
when you're alone

2253
01:33:26,036 --> 01:33:27,416
what should i do

2254
01:33:28,526 --> 01:33:29,846
I can be special tomorrow

2255
01:33:31,556 --> 01:33:31,646
To

2256
01:33:32,276 --> 01:33:33,446
i don't know if

2257
01:33:40,076 --> 01:33:41,546
If Yatsuba transfers schools

2258
01:33:42,296 --> 01:33:43,436
we will follow

2259
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:46,870
What are you saying

2260
01:33:47,186 --> 01:33:48,549
Neighborhood in a hurry

2261
01:33:48,716 --> 01:33:49,716
true intentions

2262
01:33:50,156 --> 01:33:51,236
I was able to pass

2263
01:33:51,776 --> 01:33:52,406
running

2264
01:33:52,406 --> 01:33:53,406
thanks to

2265
01:33:55,646 --> 01:33:55,796
Year

2266
01:33:56,075 --> 01:33:56,253
of

2267
01:33:56,638 --> 01:33:57,638
okay

2268
01:33:58,676 --> 01:33:59,726
we can

2269
01:34:00,116 --> 01:34:00,296
is

2270
01:34:00,896 --> 01:34:01,896
Everyone

2271
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:04,556
for me

2272
01:34:04,676 --> 01:34:04,826
To

2273
01:34:05,336 --> 01:34:06,336
guy

2274
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:08,696
I don't know what you think

2275
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:12,594
I definitely don't want you to leave

2276
01:34:14,396 --> 01:34:16,226
We're all together wherever we go

2277
01:34:17,126 --> 01:34:17,606
that is

2278
01:34:17,966 --> 01:34:19,226
Is it your mother's fault

2279
01:34:22,856 --> 01:34:23,856
four leaves

2280
01:34:23,936 --> 01:34:24,936
no matter what

2281
01:34:25,256 --> 01:34:26,546
we are all five

2282
01:34:26,756 --> 01:34:27,756
because it's a minute

2283
01:34:30,146 --> 01:34:31,146
Such

2284
01:34:31,376 --> 01:34:31,573
5

2285
01:34:31,573 --> 01:34:33,026
People can overcome

2286
01:34:34,467 --> 01:34:35,876
your mother said

2287
01:34:36,649 --> 01:34:37,390
she was saying

2288
01:34:37,559 --> 01:34:38,559
hey

2289
01:34:40,106 --> 01:34:42,716
Stop thinking about who's the best

2290
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:44,216
Then

2291
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:46,466
i live for everyone

2292
01:34:56,876 --> 01:34:57,876
Taker

2293
01:35:13,436 --> 01:35:14,436
now i

2294
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:16,409
thanks to all my sisters i'm here

2295
01:35:17,816 --> 01:35:18,816
memory

2296
01:35:20,156 --> 01:35:21,156
is

2297
01:35:34,856 --> 01:35:35,006
Raw

2298
01:35:35,156 --> 01:35:36,156
It's the department

2299
01:35:38,953 --> 01:35:40,554
all the sisters are good guys

2300
01:35:41,186 --> 01:35:41,727
Awesome

2301
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:42,086
with the guy

2302
01:35:42,566 --> 01:35:43,616
I love them

2303
01:35:45,476 --> 01:35:47,546
that I was their tutor

2304
01:35:47,816 --> 01:35:48,816
I am proud

2305
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:51,896
But

2306
01:35:52,556 --> 01:35:53,556
without you

2307
01:35:53,936 --> 01:35:55,496
I was especially empty

2308
01:36:00,566 --> 01:36:01,566
Such a thing

2309
01:36:02,337 --> 01:36:03,836
'Cause I'm a weak man

2310
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:06,795
I'll keep stumbling over and over again

2311
01:36:07,946 --> 01:36:10,346
This is my selfish wish

2312
01:36:11,576 --> 01:36:12,576
Yotsuba at that time

2313
01:36:13,526 --> 01:36:15,596
I'm happy to have you next to me

2314
01:36:18,146 --> 01:36:19,146
don't worry

2315
01:36:20,546 --> 01:36:21,956
you are my support

2316
01:36:23,006 --> 01:36:24,596
i want to support you

2317
01:36:26,006 --> 01:36:27,356
So if you don't like it, that's fine

2318
01:36:28,496 --> 01:36:30,176
let me know how you feel

2319
01:36:35,366 --> 01:36:36,366
Me

2320
01:36:37,286 --> 01:36:38,286
rabbit

2321
01:36:41,516 --> 01:36:41,756
this

2322
01:36:41,906 --> 01:36:43,046
let's get around

2323
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,046
i hate moon

2324
01:36:46,796 --> 01:36:47,216
killer

2325
01:36:47,762 --> 01:36:48,762
killer

2326
01:36:52,916 --> 01:36:53,366
clean

2327
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:54,516
is

2328
01:36:55,736 --> 01:36:56,736
Me

2329
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,256
teeth

2330
01:36:58,736 --> 01:36:58,916
Lie

2331
01:36:59,066 --> 01:36:59,396
turn on

2332
01:36:59,546 --> 01:37:00,546
not

2333
01:37:04,106 --> 01:37:05,106
I liked it

2334
01:37:11,126 --> 01:37:12,126
excuse me

2335
01:37:13,556 --> 01:37:15,656
I still have to do something

2336
01:37:21,026 --> 01:37:22,026
aren't you dating

2337
01:37:23,006 --> 01:37:24,006
actually

2338
01:37:24,746 --> 01:37:25,746
Wow

2339
01:37:27,356 --> 01:37:28,706
i'm not dating

2340
01:37:29,966 --> 01:37:30,966
that's six

2341
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,546
Mr. Taro Honfu

2342
01:37:33,236 --> 01:37:34,766
nobody's

2343
01:37:40,256 --> 01:37:40,706
Crispy

2344
01:37:40,706 --> 01:37:41,706
to be

2345
01:37:41,906 --> 01:37:43,466
You said you liked Yotsuba

2346
01:37:44,127 --> 01:37:44,546
then quantity

2347
01:37:44,846 --> 01:37:44,993
Moe

2348
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:45,356
Then

2349
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:47,726
I'll be hated if I brood over it

2350
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:52,416
I guess

2351
01:37:52,947 --> 01:37:53,947
Thanks

2352
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,416
deer

2353
01:37:57,926 --> 01:37:58,766
even if you

2354
01:37:58,766 --> 01:38:00,356
Even if the day comes when

2355
01:38:01,608 --> 01:38:01,976
However

2356
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:03,126
it was us

2357
01:38:04,286 --> 01:38:05,546
what you really said

2358
01:38:06,656 --> 01:38:07,656
now i know

2359
01:38:09,596 --> 01:38:10,376
I've been

2360
01:38:10,616 --> 01:38:12,296
I should have liked you

2361
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:13,856
They are

2362
01:38:14,122 --> 01:38:15,446
I should have picked you up yesterday

2363
01:38:16,586 --> 01:38:18,986
I don't want you to worry about me now

2364
01:38:19,496 --> 01:38:20,496
I was worried

2365
01:38:20,877 --> 01:38:22,286
really important family

2366
01:38:24,026 --> 01:38:25,026
in that case

2367
01:38:25,106 --> 01:38:26,696
we you say so far

2368
01:38:27,836 --> 01:38:30,146
If this relationship continues

2369
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:32,196
Sheet

2370
01:38:32,426 --> 01:38:33,426
let me cut

2371
01:38:39,296 --> 01:38:40,296
four leaves

2372
01:38:41,246 --> 01:38:43,886
If I stay in a place like this all the time, my body will get cold

2373
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,766
my four leaves

2374
01:38:48,536 --> 01:38:49,536
my four leaves

2375
01:38:50,606 --> 01:38:51,606
what

2376
01:38:53,156 --> 01:38:54,156
I thought

2377
01:38:55,316 --> 01:38:58,706
I won't be chosen

2378
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:01,076
Create a date with Fuutarou

2379
01:39:02,966 --> 01:39:03,966
I wonder

2380
01:39:10,016 --> 01:39:10,346
No good

2381
01:39:10,346 --> 01:39:13,286
ethically

2382
01:39:14,336 --> 01:39:17,425
ah

2383
01:39:19,796 --> 01:39:20,796
place

2384
01:39:21,446 --> 01:39:22,446
mosquito

2385
01:39:25,556 --> 01:39:27,086
just us karaoke

2386
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:27,476
to come

2387
01:39:27,866 --> 01:39:28,866
It's my first time

2388
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,016
yo four leaves

2389
01:39:36,555 --> 01:39:36,956
To

2390
01:39:37,496 --> 01:39:38,496
because it's a consultation

2391
01:39:39,266 --> 01:39:41,276
The fact that I am disguised as Yotsuba

2392
01:39:41,969 --> 01:39:42,969
is

2393
01:39:43,706 --> 01:39:45,506
Even if I can imitate Yotsuba

2394
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:47,156
I can't become a yotsuba

2395
01:39:48,026 --> 01:39:48,716
this juice

2396
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:48,836
teeth

2397
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:50,606
too sweet for me

2398
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:53,486
but i'm angry

2399
01:39:54,836 --> 01:39:55,836
if i were

2400
01:39:55,976 --> 01:39:58,346
I won't do anything to embarrass Fuutarou

2401
01:40:00,416 --> 01:40:01,916
You're at a loss for an answer

2402
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:03,986
Yotsuba becomes Fuutarou

2403
01:40:04,286 --> 01:40:06,806
I thought you liked me a little

2404
01:40:07,556 --> 01:40:08,556
I'm not lost

2405
01:40:09,536 --> 01:40:12,076
my feelings haven't changed since long ago

2406
01:40:13,136 --> 01:40:15,176
I keep thinking about Uesugi-san

2407
01:40:17,126 --> 01:40:18,386
All the more so

2408
01:40:18,986 --> 01:40:20,546
there should be no reason to hesitate

2409
01:40:21,656 --> 01:40:24,266
You're worried about school before you lived together, right?

2410
01:40:27,836 --> 01:40:29,606
don't worry about us

2411
01:40:30,116 --> 01:40:31,286
it's okay to date

2412
01:40:34,046 --> 01:40:34,526
what

2413
01:40:35,006 --> 01:40:36,006
i thought i would say

2414
01:40:37,872 --> 01:40:39,492
Somehow I knew

2415
01:40:40,512 --> 01:40:41,512
nevertheless

2416
01:40:41,562 --> 01:40:42,972
frustrating things are frustrating

2417
01:40:43,932 --> 01:40:44,932
no matter what

2418
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:46,512
emotions get irritated

2419
01:40:47,262 --> 01:40:48,492
I was that serious

2420
01:40:49,962 --> 01:40:50,962
if

2421
01:40:51,042 --> 01:40:52,332
It was the same with four leaves

2422
01:40:53,202 --> 01:40:54,762
this feeling of ours

2423
01:40:55,242 --> 01:40:56,242
I want you to accept

2424
01:40:58,782 --> 01:40:59,892
real feelings

2425
01:41:01,212 --> 01:41:03,252
i didn't understand

2426
01:41:04,572 --> 01:41:05,922
it's natural to be angry

2427
01:41:06,612 --> 01:41:06,941
Nino

2428
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:07,941
was in

2429
01:41:08,442 --> 01:41:09,442
in love

2430
01:41:09,882 --> 01:41:12,220
We are neither enemies nor friends

2431
01:41:14,922 --> 01:41:15,922
I see

2432
01:41:16,062 --> 01:41:17,592
if you think so

2433
01:41:18,282 --> 01:41:19,571
at least resistance

2434
01:41:21,042 --> 01:41:22,042
definitely

2435
01:41:22,452 --> 01:41:24,252
I won't give you a push on my back

2436
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:29,322
It's a good start

2437
01:41:30,155 --> 01:41:30,310
rice field

2438
01:41:30,432 --> 01:41:30,552
Hey you

2439
01:41:31,302 --> 01:41:32,302
listen

2440
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:32,682
Miku

2441
01:41:32,682 --> 01:41:34,270
I will definitely sing better

2442
01:41:34,662 --> 01:41:35,662
desired place

2443
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:40,872
right hand

2444
01:41:41,322 --> 01:41:42,322
To

2445
01:41:43,092 --> 01:41:45,552
As expected, if you keep asking men

2446
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:46,422
I didn't think

2447
01:41:46,542 --> 01:41:47,542
rice field

2448
01:41:49,272 --> 01:41:50,272
older sister

2449
01:41:51,192 --> 01:41:52,192
Me

2450
01:41:52,752 --> 01:41:53,752
i miss you all

2451
01:41:57,732 --> 01:41:59,502
I misunderstand one of the four leaves

2452
01:42:00,702 --> 01:42:01,702
this is dare

2453
01:42:01,902 --> 01:42:04,002
I won't tell the four leaves, but

2454
01:42:05,562 --> 01:42:06,562
That time

2455
01:42:06,762 --> 01:42:09,222
Because I chose to come to my current school

2456
01:42:09,822 --> 01:42:10,932
I met Fuutarou

2457
01:42:12,402 --> 01:42:13,722
at least i

2458
01:42:14,202 --> 01:42:15,822
i don't think it's unfortunate

2459
01:42:18,552 --> 01:42:19,991
Because I met Fuutarou

2460
01:42:22,092 --> 01:42:23,092
I

2461
01:42:25,242 --> 01:42:25,512
from

2462
01:42:25,829 --> 01:42:26,829
teeth

2463
01:42:28,062 --> 01:42:29,062
I

2464
01:42:29,112 --> 01:42:30,492
I couldn't become Yotsuba

2465
01:42:31,212 --> 01:42:32,922
Yotsuba can't be me

2466
01:42:34,302 --> 01:42:35,302
at last

2467
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:36,882
as much as you think

2468
01:42:37,872 --> 01:42:39,972
i fell in love with me

2469
01:42:42,845 --> 01:42:43,845
Moon

2470
01:42:44,922 --> 01:42:45,922
can i have a minute

2471
01:42:46,392 --> 01:42:46,542
na

2472
01:42:46,872 --> 01:42:47,892
what is it

2473
01:42:49,422 --> 01:42:50,422
what i want to talk about

2474
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,582
it's not good here

2475
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,062
then here

2476
01:43:00,702 --> 01:43:01,702
talk to me

2477
01:43:10,002 --> 01:43:10,302
Corner

2478
01:43:10,482 --> 01:43:11,482
not

2479
01:43:12,757 --> 01:43:13,757
Don `t worry

2480
01:43:15,282 --> 01:43:16,422
I feel softly

2481
01:43:17,082 --> 01:43:18,432
This chest moyamoya

2482
01:43:18,432 --> 01:43:18,582
teeth

2483
01:43:19,272 --> 01:43:20,272
Are vacant

2484
01:43:25,392 --> 01:43:28,992
Yotsuba has begun to create a place for us quintuplets.

2485
01:43:29,772 --> 01:43:30,772
you

2486
01:43:31,752 --> 01:43:32,752
buy the ground

2487
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:33,832
Hey

2488
01:43:34,032 --> 01:43:35,652
Thinking with my brother who was yesterday

2489
01:43:36,412 --> 01:43:37,412
just pushing

2490
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,320
However

2491
01:43:39,612 --> 01:43:41,352
I still think the same

2492
01:43:42,492 --> 01:43:43,512
my wish is

2493
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,872
Amazed

2494
01:43:45,132 --> 01:43:46,872
Even though you still say such sweet things

2495
01:43:47,512 --> 01:43:48,762
I admit

2496
01:43:50,022 --> 01:43:51,022
dead

2497
01:43:52,572 --> 01:43:53,572
rat

2498
01:43:53,922 --> 01:43:54,402
mouse or rat

2499
01:43:54,402 --> 01:43:55,402
there is

2500
01:43:57,235 --> 01:43:58,235
hey

2501
01:43:58,308 --> 01:43:59,922
After all, prefectures are strict

2502
01:44:01,182 --> 01:44:02,381
please stay away

2503
01:44:03,162 --> 01:44:04,162
Such a place

2504
01:44:04,581 --> 01:44:06,102
I can show you to the quatrefoils

2505
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:08,772
Lunch break will be over

2506
01:44:09,192 --> 01:44:10,192
I'm going home

2507
01:44:15,402 --> 01:44:17,794
I came to tell you with my own determination

2508
01:44:18,552 --> 01:44:19,552
my wish is

2509
01:44:20,113 --> 01:44:22,692
To have my relationship with Mr. Uesugi recognized

2510
01:44:22,842 --> 01:44:23,842
Head down with

2511
01:44:24,267 --> 01:44:24,509
that

2512
01:44:24,672 --> 01:44:25,901
not now

2513
01:44:27,432 --> 01:44:28,432
months

2514
01:44:29,892 --> 01:44:31,992
I don't know how long it will take

2515
01:44:33,072 --> 01:44:35,172
how much i love uesugi sa

2516
01:44:35,562 --> 01:44:35,862
this

2517
01:44:35,982 --> 01:44:36,982
strength of thought

2518
01:44:37,694 --> 01:44:38,694
I want you to

2519
01:44:42,252 --> 01:44:43,252
yes

2520
01:44:43,632 --> 01:44:46,722
Even if the current you apologizes or persuades me

2521
01:44:47,442 --> 01:44:49,302
I can't believe you

2522
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,369
knowing that

2523
01:44:52,092 --> 01:44:54,462
You're going to take the road of thorns, aren't you?

2524
01:44:55,302 --> 01:44:55,932
I

2525
01:44:56,322 --> 01:44:58,302
As much as I love Uesugi-san

2526
01:44:58,962 --> 01:45:00,462
Because I like everyone in the play

2527
01:45:01,653 --> 01:45:02,653
not at all

2528
01:45:03,102 --> 01:45:04,102
I don't know

2529
01:45:04,752 --> 01:45:05,951
It seems to be Takeda four leaves

2530
01:45:10,362 --> 01:45:13,332
Released from the shackles of the quintuplets, they push forward

2531
01:45:14,478 --> 01:45:16,422
I don't like your back

2532
01:45:16,872 --> 01:45:17,872
I was envious

2533
01:45:19,572 --> 01:45:20,892
you still me

2534
01:45:21,372 --> 01:45:23,892
Do you see me as a rival to you?

2535
01:45:24,432 --> 01:45:25,432
sure

2536
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:26,652
we

2537
01:45:26,922 --> 01:45:29,322
We'll live while being conscious of each other all the time

2538
01:45:30,132 --> 01:45:31,132
sometimes friends

2539
01:45:31,692 --> 01:45:32,692
sometimes a waterfall

2540
01:45:34,272 --> 01:45:35,272
rival

2541
01:45:36,042 --> 01:45:37,042
Hey you

2542
01:45:37,872 --> 01:45:39,612
The battle isn't over here

2543
01:45:39,852 --> 01:45:42,612
I'll watch over your future from a little behind

2544
01:45:43,729 --> 01:45:45,192
If I show you that I like you even a little

2545
01:45:45,732 --> 01:45:47,712
I wonder if you'll just take me away

2546
01:45:50,532 --> 01:45:51,532
hey

2547
01:45:53,142 --> 01:45:54,462
I wonder if it's about time

2548
01:45:54,785 --> 01:45:56,592
Hey, please take over two people who have already done

2549
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,292
did you notice

2550
01:46:04,992 --> 01:46:05,992
maybe forever

2551
01:46:10,572 --> 01:46:11,622
You were good

2552
01:46:13,692 --> 01:46:13,932
yes

2553
01:46:14,112 --> 01:46:15,112
because it means

2554
01:46:15,462 --> 01:46:17,472
Yume Yume Don't let your guard down

2555
01:46:18,942 --> 01:46:20,142
I'll keep that in mind

2556
01:46:21,222 --> 01:46:24,342
You ended up putting out your hand in trouble

2557
01:46:25,272 --> 01:46:26,272
but

2558
01:46:26,442 --> 01:46:27,762
I can say that I did it with this

2559
01:46:29,652 --> 01:46:30,652
you

2560
01:46:31,242 --> 01:46:32,242
Not alone

2561
01:46:34,032 --> 01:46:35,032
Uesugi-kun

2562
01:46:35,862 --> 01:46:36,862
Congrats

2563
01:46:47,682 --> 01:46:49,212
actually invited

2564
01:46:49,602 --> 01:46:50,862
thank you

2565
01:46:51,013 --> 01:46:52,452
bad for holidays

2566
01:46:54,072 --> 01:46:54,492
such

2567
01:46:55,062 --> 01:46:56,062
I'm happy

2568
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:57,375
Really

2569
01:47:01,782 --> 01:47:02,782
Somehow

2570
01:47:02,952 --> 01:47:04,842
We couldn't be alone at school

2571
01:47:06,612 --> 01:47:07,612
surely

2572
01:47:07,832 --> 01:47:08,534
where who

2573
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:09,972
i don't know from

2574
01:47:16,572 --> 01:47:17,572
practiced

2575
01:47:17,832 --> 01:47:18,832
to the customer

2576
01:47:19,122 --> 01:47:19,392
this

2577
01:47:20,052 --> 01:47:21,052
not the other way around

2578
01:47:22,213 --> 01:47:22,392
mother

2579
01:47:22,692 --> 01:47:22,872
is

2580
01:47:23,502 --> 01:47:23,952
here we go

2581
01:47:24,432 --> 01:47:26,352
You can order whatever you want as much as you like

2582
01:47:26,712 --> 01:47:27,712
it's my treat

2583
01:47:30,762 --> 01:47:31,762
that was good

2584
01:47:32,952 --> 01:47:33,952
frustrating

2585
01:47:35,017 --> 01:47:35,322
dating

2586
01:47:35,322 --> 01:47:36,522
destination is family restaurant

2587
01:47:36,522 --> 01:47:37,522
Nanoyo

2588
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:38,725

2599
01:47:46,272 --> 01:47:48,672
For Fuutarou, you're the one who did your best.

2600
01:47:49,752 --> 01:47:50,352
If you think

2601
01:47:50,622 --> 01:47:52,752
I'm getting a recommendation from a sports college.

2602
01:47:53,502 --> 01:47:53,862
yes

2603
01:47:54,492 --> 01:47:54,882
Then

2604
01:47:55,242 --> 01:47:55,782
after all

2605
01:47:56,143 --> 01:47:57,143
dreams

2606
01:47:57,342 --> 01:47:58,362
some sport

2607
01:47:58,362 --> 01:47:59,362
become a player

2608
01:48:01,332 --> 01:48:03,882
I forgot my childhood dream

2609
01:48:04,392 --> 01:48:05,392
I am after all

2610
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:06,762
someone's support

2611
01:48:06,762 --> 01:48:07,962
to support

2612
01:48:08,112 --> 01:48:09,552
i think it suits me

2613
01:48:10,362 --> 01:48:12,042
It started with giving up

2614
01:48:12,942 --> 01:48:15,462
Now I realize that everyone can be proud

2615
01:48:16,842 --> 01:48:17,842
it seems like you

2616
01:48:19,666 --> 01:48:20,666
I got one

2617
01:48:21,012 --> 01:48:22,452
Because Mr. Uesugi said so

2618
01:48:23,482 --> 01:48:24,482
yes

2619
01:48:25,402 --> 01:48:25,599
yes

2620
01:48:25,782 --> 01:48:26,782
is

2621
01:48:27,702 --> 01:48:28,122
raw

2622
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:30,012
if i get accepted to university

2623
01:48:30,342 --> 01:48:33,102
I want to study so that I can get such a job.

2624
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:34,882
Really

2625
01:48:45,972 --> 01:48:46,482
the bad is

2626
01:48:46,962 --> 01:48:48,342
library was boring

2627
01:48:50,652 --> 01:48:51,732
With Mr. Uesugi

2628
01:48:51,912 --> 01:48:53,832
anything is great fun

2629
01:48:54,432 --> 01:48:55,432
Then

2630
01:48:55,872 --> 01:48:56,292
At the end

2631
01:48:56,472 --> 01:48:57,472
just one place

2632
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:02,452
Yatsuba

2633
01:49:03,072 --> 01:49:05,262
It looks like you don't have to push your back anymore

2634
01:49:10,152 --> 01:49:11,152
It's nostalgic

2635
01:49:15,492 --> 01:49:15,999
you

2636
01:49:16,482 --> 01:49:16,992
this rag

2637
01:49:16,992 --> 01:49:17,302
blank

2638
01:49:17,302 --> 01:49:18,302
if you liked

2639
01:49:18,672 --> 01:49:18,882
today

2640
01:49:19,062 --> 01:49:19,242
teeth

2641
01:49:19,722 --> 01:49:23,172
I'm sure Uesugi-san will take you to a place that has a special place in your heart.

2642
01:49:25,272 --> 01:49:26,982
A family restaurant that the family sometimes goes to

2643
01:49:27,792 --> 01:49:29,441
library for studying

2644
01:49:31,092 --> 01:49:32,352
Your time is from that day

2645
01:49:33,372 --> 01:49:34,542
here is one of them

2646
01:49:38,923 --> 01:49:39,042
Good

2647
01:49:39,162 --> 01:49:40,162
It's

2648
01:49:40,692 --> 01:49:42,492
really still confused

2649
01:49:44,592 --> 01:49:46,208
aside from all my sisters

2650
01:49:47,382 --> 01:49:48,382
only

2651
01:49:48,786 --> 01:49:50,802
I wonder if it's okay to be happy

2652
01:49:51,702 --> 01:49:51,852
mosquito

2653
01:49:51,972 --> 01:49:52,972
choice is

2654
01:49:53,022 --> 01:49:54,250
I wonder if it's right

2655
01:49:57,069 --> 01:49:57,432
you

2656
01:49:58,092 --> 01:49:59,622
You just flew from here

2657
01:50:00,222 --> 01:50:01,222
show me again

2658
01:50:04,572 --> 01:50:05,652
then it's cheap

2659
01:50:05,802 --> 01:50:06,802
is for

2660
01:50:21,582 --> 01:50:22,582
how is it

2661
01:50:23,022 --> 01:50:23,442
Yotsuba

2662
01:50:23,652 --> 01:50:24,652
of

2663
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:26,382
if i could fly that far

2664
01:50:27,132 --> 01:50:28,362
I have a story to tell you

2665
01:50:29,609 --> 01:50:29,862
that

2666
01:50:30,072 --> 01:50:30,222
teeth

2667
01:50:30,492 --> 01:50:31,492
let's go

2668
01:50:32,115 --> 01:50:32,232
death

2669
01:50:32,352 --> 01:50:33,352
please don't

2670
01:50:33,552 --> 01:50:34,552
look at me

2671
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,780
I should be able to go further

2672
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:03,760
one

2673
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:05,620
Such

2674
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:06,060
dating

2675
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,700
Because I'm an inexperienced person who can't do one thing

2676
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,660
nevertheless

2677
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:13,290
I can be the man who stands next to you

2678
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:14,650
get promoted

2679
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,720
the right way

2680
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,160
wrong way

2681
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:20,730
let's walk together

2682
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:22,900
that's why

2683
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,660
if you like

2684
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:26,710
with me

2685
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,120
this is

2686
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:32,170
I like it

2687
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,880
marry me

2688
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:48,570
master

2689
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:49,900
is

2690
01:51:53,092 --> 01:51:53,286
yes

2691
01:51:53,818 --> 01:51:54,818
that's true

2692
01:51:55,915 --> 01:51:56,220
more

2693
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:57,210
clean

2694
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:57,990
from the beginning

2695
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:58,920
if you say

2696
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:00,460
world

2697
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:00,930
Me

2698
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:02,430
It's just another story

2699
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:04,180
smartphone

2700
01:52:04,712 --> 01:52:06,420
let me start over just one more time

2701
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:08,520
pot

2702
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:10,469
childhood dream

2703
01:52:11,717 --> 01:52:12,717
remembered

2704
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:15,510
everyone longed for

2705
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:19,990
I want to hurry

2706
01:52:20,656 --> 01:52:27,438
hmm

2707
01:52:28,710 --> 01:52:29,710
It's a promise

2708
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:31,840
Surely someday

2709
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,320
please make my dream come true

2710
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:40,033
ah

2711
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:03,960
character

2712
01:53:04,316 --> 01:53:04,629
fruit

2713
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:05,970
Hana to you

2714
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:08,380
to you

2715
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:10,286
There's something I must say

2716
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:12,709
university i attend

2717
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:14,810
couldn't you say

2718
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:17,290
tokyo rider

2719
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:20,010
I know that

2720
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,430
I didn't dare to ask

2721
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:25,440
I guess you

2722
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,040
I thought

2723
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:26,310
Hmm

2724
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:27,790
is not it

2725
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,850
we don't care at all

2726
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:32,380
ancestor

2727
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:33,570
exam

2728
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:34,960
Good luck

2729
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:35,610
When

2730
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:36,990
I'll go see you too

2731
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:39,520
Thanks

2732
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,305
nice to meet you

2733
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:43,810
See you

2734
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,560
Also

2735
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:54,690
It was as expected

2736
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,880
It was rare to feel lonely

2737
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,300
but

2738
01:53:58,350 --> 01:53:59,430
maybe a little happy

2739
01:54:00,048 --> 01:54:01,048
Uesugi-san

2740
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:02,370
During

2741
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:03,060
is seen

2742
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:04,270
increase

2743
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,070
don't cry

2744
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:09,190
I decided

2745
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:23,970
dreams or goals

2746
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:26,880
I wonder if I can be like you

2747
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:28,860
Humans can do it

2748
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:30,430
if we

2749
01:54:33,931 --> 01:54:34,931
just a little more

2750
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:36,900
I'll keep you company

2751
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:39,820
Is that so

2752
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:53,073
hmm

2753
01:54:53,207 --> 01:54:54,207
come on

2754
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,240
It's time to go

2755
01:54:56,156 --> 01:54:57,156
death

2756
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:10,660
Me

2757
01:55:15,369 --> 01:55:15,694
Hey you

2758
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:17,050
guy

2759
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:19,800
Living alone after college

2760
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,870
really not unreasonable

2761
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:25,470
Ichikawa is worried

2762
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:27,090
she was drowning

2763
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:27,840
I'm fine

2764
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,320
That's right

2765
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:31,500
we all

2766
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:38,999
I'm nervous without any pain

2767
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:40,080
mosquito

2768
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:41,260
Hey

2769
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:42,180
that's why

2770
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,750
i'm not alone

2771
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:53,848
ah

2772
01:56:18,270 --> 01:56:19,270

2773
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,040
rice

2774
01:56:21,601 --> 01:56:28,320
hmm

2775
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:39,599
mm

2776
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:41,550
sometimes

2777
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:42,900
make it soon

2778
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,010
Then we will prepare

2779
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,620
Gathering after a long time

2780
01:56:50,913 --> 01:56:54,374
Hmm

2781
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:56,040
Some countries don't change

2782
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:01,420
Came back

2783
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:02,890
Japan

2784
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:04,980
you were just traveling

2785
01:57:07,732 --> 01:57:08,732
Moon

2786
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,120
thank you for coming

2787
01:57:11,738 --> 01:57:12,990
because you're famous

2788
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:17,170
welcome

2789
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:20,020
you guys

2790
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:20,910
sometimes

2791
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:22,300
long time no see

2792
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:25,050
I'm glad both of you are fine

2793
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,870
The shop seems to be thriving too.

2794
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:30,180
As expected of America

2795
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:30,991
Rash is a joke

2796
01:57:30,991 --> 01:57:31,991
is good at speaking

2797
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:35,850
real america

2798
01:57:35,850 --> 01:57:36,850
How was it when you went to

2799
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:39,750
still intonation

2800
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:40,980
I'm worried about only

2801
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:42,550
sometimes

2802
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:43,870
intonation

2803
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:46,150
It's tough

2804
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,300
I guess it's because I'm a teacher

2805
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,020
you're going to eat

2806
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,640
don't prepare now

2807
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:52,080
or

2808
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:53,440
Hey

2809
01:57:53,550 --> 01:57:54,120
America

2810
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:54,600
Anna of

2811
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:55,320
quaint cafe

2812
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,090
Will it suit the taste of the person in

2813
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:00,090
I also went to Sue Express

2814
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:00,569
To

2815
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:00,810
teeth

2816
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,190
always family inn

2817
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:02,400
star

2818
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,400
I'm watching you

2819
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:04,260
hey

2820
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:05,370
it's not

2821
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:06,208
That's it

2822
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:08,940
Then, as a thank you, I will introduce this shop to you.

2823
01:58:09,063 --> 01:58:09,333
hand

2824
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:10,630
Buried

2825
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:12,720
If you take advantage of the popularity of the day

2826
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,760
The number of customers will definitely increase

2827
01:58:15,602 --> 01:58:16,650
I'm very happy

2828
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,415
I still refrain from it now

2829
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,361
Recently, the number of regular customers has increased.

2830
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:26,430
Lent me this well-equipped place

2831
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:28,140
for your father

2832
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:31,620
I want to do it with our own strength just a little more

2833
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:35,070
na

2834
01:58:35,461 --> 01:58:36,461
Noni

2835
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,219
proud sister

2836
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:40,500
No matter where I go, I'm not ashamed

2837
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:44,580
If you don't sell well, you can let me work for you

2838
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:46,350
you're not cute

2839
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,180
that is cute

2840
01:58:53,070 --> 01:58:53,430
Everyone

2841
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:55,410
It's the appearance of today's leading role

2842
01:58:58,050 --> 01:58:59,159
all together

2843
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:00,929
why are you sweating

2844
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:05,550
I guess he couldn't sit still and came running from home on his bicycle.

2845
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:07,270
I've been

2846
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:10,350
what just before an important ceremony

2847
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:11,040
I don't care

2848
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:13,860
As expected, Uesugi-kun is a train, isn't he?

2849
01:59:14,610 --> 01:59:16,260
Fuutarou has been here since yesterday

2850
01:59:16,830 --> 01:59:17,830
so i'm still sleeping

2851
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,658
Chan

2852
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:21,360
eh

2853
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:22,470
what

2854
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:25,050
I have to admit this

2855
01:59:26,430 --> 01:59:28,740
That's why I secretly read it early in the morning

2856
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:31,080
my makeup

2857
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,080
thank you for coming

2858
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:33,520
very

2859
01:59:34,290 --> 01:59:35,790
what are you scared of

2860
01:59:36,483 --> 01:59:38,908
You didn't want to ride it, did you?

2861
01:59:39,210 --> 01:59:41,159
Uesugi-kun must make sure

2862
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:42,390
1

2863
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:43,390
Day

2864
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,970
I want to wear it This is our wedding present

2865
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:50,520
mother's keepsake earrings

2866
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:52,080
The guy

2867
01:59:52,650 --> 01:59:53,820
I can guarantee

2868
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:54,690
Hey you

2869
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:56,230

2870
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:57,690

Hey

2873
02:00:00,330 --> 02:00:00,600

2874
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:02,110

2875
02:00:28,230 --> 02:00:29,230
groom

2876
02:00:29,370 --> 02:00:31,680
The bride's relatives have arrived

2877
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:33,430
Was good

2878
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,860
I thought you weren't coming

2879
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:37,559
why didn't you come to the ceremony

2880
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:39,720
sorry

2881
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:41,456
to come or not

2882
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:43,590
I was thinking about it until just before

2883
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:47,990
I don't deserve to be called your father

2884
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:49,740

2885
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:50,900
thank you

2886
02:00:51,470 --> 02:00:54,049
In the past, many rudeness due to youth was too profitable

2887
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:56,420
ask straight

2888
02:00:57,290 --> 02:00:58,290
yes

2889
02:00:58,370 --> 02:01:00,470

I'm back

2896
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,980
Fuutarou's Waiting Room

2897
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:20,840
my mother died

2898
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,579
more than ten years ago

2899
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:24,650
the accident happened

2900
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:28,220
It was just after her mother's dream of opening her own restaurant.

2901
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:30,200
was left inside

2902
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:33,230
Only a large amount of debt borrowed for start-up funds

2903
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:34,880
father never again

2904
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:35,240
To

2905
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:36,905
That vacant store is in Kashitaru

2906
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:39,200
half to help them

2907
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,920
and half

2908
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:43,640
It may have been to entrust her mother's dream

2909
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,850
love one woman for the rest of one's life

2910
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,490
I want to be that kind of man

2911
02:01:50,883 --> 02:01:51,883
is like the father of

2912
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:54,900
will finance

2913
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:55,280
right

2914
02:01:55,735 --> 02:01:56,735
excuse me

2915
02:01:58,700 --> 02:01:59,780
i'm not used to it

2916
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,090
I don't want to be called my father

2917
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:04,470
groom

2918
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,050
the bride is calling

2919
02:02:06,290 --> 02:02:07,290
Please come

2920
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:08,790
Um

2921
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:09,900
go ahead

2922
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,860
eh

2923
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:23,240
marlowe

2924
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:23,450
world

2925
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,639
I'm old too

2926
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:29,247
Wasn't alcohol only used for celebrations?

2927
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,370
That's it

2928
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:33,950
that's why i'm drinking

2929
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:37,100
Those guys

2930
02:02:37,341 --> 02:02:38,341
i think it will work

2931
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:40,230
such a thing

2932
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:42,620
It's not something parents can decide

2933
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:44,400
however

2934
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,880
It is certain that it will not be easy

2935
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:48,650
anyway the opponent

2936
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:50,840
because she's my daughter

2937
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:02,220
yes

2938
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:04,320
that

2939
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:06,470
I can tell

2940
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:11,460
ladies and gentlemen

2941
02:03:11,630 --> 02:03:13,250
busy today

2942
02:03:13,401 --> 02:03:16,010
Thank you for joining us at our wedding reception

2943
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,840
Thank you very much

2944
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,029
so beautiful

2945
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:23,298
again

2946
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,010
Like a four-leaf handle

2947
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:26,660
Wedding with such fun

2948
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:26,930
dress

2949
02:03:26,961 --> 02:03:27,961
I want to wear it

2950
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,750
do you know what you're doing

2951
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:32,450
Sure it's a little complicated

2952
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:34,430
I said sweet things

2953
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:35,510
moreover

2954
02:03:35,724 --> 02:03:36,800
It's not wasabi

2955
02:03:38,090 --> 02:03:39,957
Even this is Hanayama's exclusive

2956
02:03:42,113 --> 02:03:42,590
Sadao Abe

2957
02:03:43,007 --> 02:03:44,007
is in a position

2958
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:46,280
Me

2959
02:03:46,879 --> 02:03:48,350
Speaking of worries, I

2960
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:49,560
Wind Taro

2961
02:03:49,730 --> 02:03:50,730
you know

2962
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:51,380
Then

2963
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:52,010
fool

2964
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:52,250
bastard

2965
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:55,610
When I think I've become a sensible adult

2966
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:58,310
I was relieved that it seemed to be the same

2967
02:03:58,880 --> 02:03:59,880
lick me

2968
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:01,740
Omae Maeda

2969
02:04:02,090 --> 02:04:02,690
again

2970
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,220
thank you family

2971
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:06,380
I'm here today

2972
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:07,309
father

2973
02:04:07,488 --> 02:04:07,667
teeth

2974
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:08,870
As expected

2975
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:10,730
thanks to all my sisters

2976
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:14,630
I'm glad that my father became my father

2977
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:18,380
you have a day

2978
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Ichikawa, the eldest daughter

2979
02:04:21,470 --> 02:04:24,620
She is a big sister who brings us all together.

2980
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:28,070
As you know, she is a very successful actress.

2981
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:29,240
my

2982
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:30,740
It is an existence of longing

2983
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:34,100
I was surprised by your sister.

2984
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:35,480
It's nostalgic

2985
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:38,000
The roundabout was quite difficult

2986
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:38,810
Cool

2987
02:04:38,810 --> 02:04:39,170
beauty

2988
02:04:39,203 --> 02:04:40,760
What in the world are you singing

2989
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:42,530
i won't be fooled

2990
02:04:43,610 --> 02:04:44,000
stupidity

2991
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:45,210
indulge in drowsiness

2992
02:04:45,710 --> 02:04:46,169
Taida

2993
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:46,880
world

2994
02:04:47,090 --> 02:04:48,440
even if you don't say that

2995
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:50,010
nevertheless

2996
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:52,070
The appearance of trying to be strong

2997
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:53,690
i can't see it dazzling

2998
02:04:54,290 --> 02:04:55,430
that's a big plus

2999
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:56,822
Hey

3000
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:00,720
you're next

3001
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:02,760
Brother

3002
02:05:03,514 --> 02:05:04,514
then what

3003
02:05:04,550 --> 02:05:05,660
A little angry

3004
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:06,998
soggy

3005
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:07,580
strictly

3006
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,520
You are the older sister who pushes us on the back.

3007
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,530
Then my power is outstanding

3008
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:14,719
I have to follow suit too

3009
02:05:15,890 --> 02:05:16,940
Is it the rest of my life?

3010
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:18,390
yes yes

3011
02:05:18,590 --> 02:05:19,041
Was good

3012
02:05:19,190 --> 02:05:20,190
hey

3013
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:23,790
at a time like this

3014
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:25,970
all you have to do is give

3015
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:28,050
your strength

3016
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,522
The flip side of that one-fold weakness

3017
02:05:31,370 --> 02:05:32,370
rigor

3018
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:34,520
Because there is so much love

3019
02:05:35,630 --> 02:05:36,630
I used to be

3020
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,960
couldn't find the answer

3021
02:05:41,721 --> 02:05:42,721
yes

3022
02:05:44,990 --> 02:05:45,467
I

3023
02:05:45,867 --> 02:05:46,867
do

3024
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:49,140
Really

3025
02:05:53,660 --> 02:05:53,990
make

3026
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:54,990
I guess

3027
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:56,960
3

3028
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:57,350
three of the company

3029
02:05:57,475 --> 02:05:57,592
teeth

3030
02:05:57,980 --> 02:06:00,380
It's not like Fushigi and her older sister

3031
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:04,400
It may be close to a close friend who has been in contact with you in the same position

3032
02:06:05,210 --> 02:06:06,210
that's why

3033
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:08,000
Meat that made my dreams come true

3034
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:09,180
I am joining

3035
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:14,810
I get anxious sometimes

3036
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:15,859
Me

3037
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:17,510
I wonder if I'm doing well

3038
02:06:18,110 --> 02:06:19,520
I don't even have to answer

3039
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:23,000
you've always fought yourself like that

3040
02:06:23,690 --> 02:06:25,220
The result I won

3041
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,140
it's definitely your fault

3042
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:28,860
believe in yourself

3043
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:31,070
you're old man

3044
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:33,830
I thought you would say that

3045
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,120
direction

3046
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,720
If so

3047
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:39,210
The rest is Komaeda

3048
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:40,470
find

3049
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:43,130
I

3050
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:43,460
four

3051
02:06:43,730 --> 02:06:44,730
only

3052
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:47,790
What

3053
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:48,200
hey

3054
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:49,100
Then

3055
02:06:49,820 --> 02:06:50,820
it's a good month

3056
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:52,950
is dead

3057
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:54,260
When is

3058
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:57,449
Cute motor that I can only be a big sister

3059
02:06:57,449 --> 02:06:58,449
is

3060
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:59,990
actually more than me

3061
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:01,580
I've been doing it properly

3062
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:04,550
When I'm wondering what to do

3063
02:07:05,210 --> 02:07:06,564
The one who gave me a push on my back

3064
02:07:06,681 --> 02:07:07,681
it's the moon

3065
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:10,157
let it run

3066
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:10,520
hand

3067
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:12,980
At this time, let me say

3068
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:14,540
since i met you

3069
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,460
my life started to go crazy

3070
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:17,840
period relationship

3071
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:18,830
Industry curry

3072
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:19,890
It's okay

3073
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:21,800
I

3074
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:24,020
Such delicacy until I meet you

3075
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:26,720
I could not imagine that there are people without

3076
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:28,760
head big natural wood

3077
02:07:30,410 --> 02:07:33,110
After all, you are unlikely to be a match for the rest of your life

3078
02:07:33,397 --> 02:07:33,919
Moon

3079
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:35,420
medium i return to tone

3080
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:37,140
I can't help it

3081
02:07:37,670 --> 02:07:38,810
Against Fuutarou

3082
02:07:39,470 --> 02:07:41,570
Even with this, I'm living to the fullest

3083
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:49,910
and you

3084
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:52,350
It's four leaves

3085
02:08:02,396 --> 02:08:03,396
is

3086
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:09,380
all my sisters were gone

3087
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:13,050
my life was completely different

3088
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:17,780
I also felt that there were many things called quintuplets

3089
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:18,650
Hey

3090
02:08:18,837 --> 02:08:19,260
7

3091
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:19,550
Sheet

3092
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:20,910
hundreds of times

3093
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:22,670
I still have fun memories

3094
02:08:27,170 --> 02:08:29,838
If you've been dating for this long, you'll remember even if you don't like it

3095
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:32,000
i was a tutor

3096
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:34,430
I learned a lot from you

3097
02:08:35,870 --> 02:08:37,592
I met you quintuplets

3098
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:39,770
I'm one of the few people I'm proud of

3099
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:41,240
I

3100
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:44,360
Being able to be born as quintuplets sisters with everyone

3101
02:08:44,690 --> 02:08:45,690
I was happy

3102
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:47,960
A little different from other houses

3103
02:08:48,230 --> 02:08:50,625
It may look strange to people.

3104
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,650
I

3105
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:53,510
i love that kind of family

3106
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,400
five years

3107
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:04,610
This is finally the end

3108
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:08,870
I also got rid of the thread of tension and got tired all at once

3109
02:09:09,584 --> 02:09:11,720
You were nervous too, weren't you?

3110
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:13,873
Wind Taro

3111
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
not as much

3112
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:16,217
kiss of oath

3113
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:17,270
and stipulated blu blu

3114
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:18,360
was

3115
02:09:18,543 --> 02:09:19,790
That can't be helped

3116
02:09:20,421 --> 02:09:21,421
everyone is watching

3117
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,100
even with you

3118
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:23,809
5

3119
02:09:23,809 --> 02:09:25,340
i remember a year ago

3120
02:09:31,507 --> 02:09:32,810
that is after all

3121
02:09:33,110 --> 02:09:34,110
bride

3122
02:09:35,270 --> 02:09:37,460
I forgot something in the waiting room

3123
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:39,620
thank you

3124
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:40,770

sorry

3126
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:45,980
I don't need it anymore

3127
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:48,110
please throw it away

3128
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:50,160
Understood

3129
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:51,780
is it ok

3130
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:52,880
trademark

3131
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:53,148
mud

3132
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:53,750
Good

3133
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:54,870
I don't know

3134
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:55,970
you

3135
02:09:56,150 --> 02:09:57,620
each person is special

3136
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:00,830
I cheat sometimes

3137
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,560
there is someone who notices me

3138
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:08,049
Hmm

3139
02:10:13,550 --> 02:10:14,810
what are you doing

3140
02:10:15,410 --> 02:10:16,410
Gatera-sama

3141
02:10:17,162 --> 02:10:18,162
i liked it

3142
02:10:18,778 --> 02:10:19,790
if it is decided

3143
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:22,220
One thing to do after the ceremony

3144
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:24,080
travel or

3145
02:10:24,349 --> 02:10:24,679
mother

3146
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:25,700
to

3147
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,200
I was going to follow you

3148
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:28,410
rice field

3149
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:30,350
Because I'm worried about where it's going

3150
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:32,330
these guys are extreme

3151
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:35,900
It's more fun when we're all together

3152
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:38,389
here we go

3153
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:39,410
Who

3154
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:41,270
I want to go

3155
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:43,309
Yotsuba says so

3156
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:46,637
I couldn't drink for the same thing before

3157
02:10:49,116 --> 02:10:50,116
then let's go

3158
02:10:51,132 --> 02:10:53,563
Hmm

3159
02:10:56,526 --> 02:10:57,633
Kyu Uesugi wake up

3160
02:11:02,676 --> 02:11:03,486
good morning

3161
02:11:03,606 --> 02:11:03,816
increase

3162
02:11:04,416 --> 02:11:07,476
Watching Fuutarou made me sleepy too

3163
02:11:07,656 --> 02:11:11,196
If you catch a cold, don't sleep in such a place and get up early

3164
02:11:11,916 --> 02:11:12,916
the wedding

3165
02:11:17,496 --> 02:11:17,886
what

3166
02:11:18,246 --> 02:11:19,566
you're quick

3167
02:11:20,976 --> 02:11:22,686
don't be half asleep forever

3168
02:11:22,866 --> 02:11:23,976
Four quick decisions

3169
02:11:24,306 --> 02:11:24,516
Man

3170
02:11:24,937 --> 02:11:25,937
trip

3171
02:11:25,986 --> 02:11:26,986
Graduation trip

3172
02:11:27,516 --> 02:11:29,346
Fuutarou suggested it.

3173
02:11:31,686 --> 02:11:31,896
Lie

3174
02:11:32,212 --> 02:11:33,212
in this case

3175
02:11:34,026 --> 02:11:34,836
5 for the time being

3176
02:11:34,836 --> 02:11:35,946
It's a human pointing

3177
02:11:36,456 --> 02:11:39,426
You know my opinion

3178
02:11:39,756 --> 02:11:41,616
I think I should stop too

3179
02:11:42,246 --> 02:11:44,136
See you soon

3180
02:11:45,634 --> 02:11:46,634
Hey

3181
02:11:48,636 --> 02:11:50,076
Ryoma Sakamoto Ugly

3182
02:11:50,766 --> 02:11:52,866
It's no different than a school trip, isn't it?

3183
02:11:53,256 --> 02:11:54,256
from Okinawa and

3184
02:11:54,606 --> 02:11:56,740
Hokkaido has a lot of delicious food.

3185
02:11:56,926 --> 02:11:57,926
hey

3186
02:11:58,116 --> 02:11:59,916
There are many nice places

3187
02:12:01,536 --> 02:12:01,956
cocoa

3188
02:12:01,956 --> 02:12:02,956
Chan

3189
02:12:05,826 --> 02:12:06,826
Nice to meet you back then

3190
02:12:23,376 --> 02:12:28,416
hmm

3191
02:12:29,706 --> 02:12:31,416
Quintuplets are troublesome

3192
02:12:44,076 --> 02:12:45,076
Dana

3193
02:12:45,632 --> 02:12:47,127
I don't know

3194
02:12:49,956 --> 02:12:50,956
Ta

3195
02:12:51,756 --> 02:12:53,796
Hey hey hey hey hey

02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:55,900

3202
02:13:13,506 --> 02:13:13,806

Hey

3221
02:14:17,826 --> 02:14:20,886
Then

3222
02:14:39,276 --> 02:14:39,546

Then

3228
02:15:00,306 --> 02:15:01,306
Good

3229
02:15:07,986 --> 02:15:08,136
